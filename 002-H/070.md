# Anyone Can Claim a Token For Another User user

## Summary
The `getReward` at line [125](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/37ddbb69e0c7fb6510f1ec99162fd9172ec44733/truflation-contracts/src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol#L126) has a bug  
## Vulnerability Detail
The `getReward` allow users to claim reward by specifying  an address to receive the `rewardToken`, but there is an issues there,  the functions allow user input address to get the reward, this allow a malicious user to claim the reward for a user even without their intention .
`Note`: There is no loss of funds, not that im aware of , but user will have his reward given even if hes not intended to do so.

and also , the sponsor confirm to me that:
 ```solidity
// "users can call getRewards, but they cannot call stake, and withdarw functions"
```
## Impact
Imagine this scenario:
1. `Alice` wants her `rewardsToekn` to reach a certain threshold(value) in order for her to claim it for any purpose it may be.
2. Malicious `bob` did some research to find out about the address of `alice`
3. `Bob` then call the `getReward` function with `alice's` address as argument  and sent the tokens to her without her intentions .

The will potentially discourage user from staking due to not  getting their `rewardToken` at their desired time. 
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/37ddbb69e0c7fb6510f1ec99162fd9172ec44733/truflation-contracts/src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol#L126-133

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Had the `getReward` function wasn't called in `VotingEscrowTruf.sol` the recommendation  will be  to : 

Remove the `user` parameter and allow the `msg.sender` to get the reward like : 
```solidity
function getReward() public updateReward(msg.sender) returns (uint256 reward) {
    reward = rewards[msg.sender];
    if (reward != 0) {
        rewards[msg.sender] = 0;
        IERC20(rewardsToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, reward);
        emit RewardPaid(msg.sender, reward);
    }
}
```

Now that it has been called from an external contract, the solution will be by adding the `onlyOperator` modifier  to allow only the external contract to called the function since only the `msg.sender ` has been specify in the  [VotingEscrowTruf.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/37ddbb69e0c7fb6510f1ec99162fd9172ec44733/truflation-contracts/src/token/VotingEscrowTruf.sol#L257)  , it will be something like : 

```solidity
+ function getReward(address user) public updateReward(user) onlyOperator returns (uint256 reward) {
        reward = rewards[user];
        if (reward != 0) {
            rewards[user] = 0;
            IERC20(rewardsToken).safeTransfer(user, reward);
            emit RewardPaid(user, reward);
        }
    }
```

`Note`: the developers should ensure that this recommendation does not break the core functionality of another function or another contract
