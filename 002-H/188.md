# `migrateUser` will lead to loss of user staking rewards

## Summary

`migrateUser` is used by admin in case user loses their private key. However, this function does not migrate staking rewards as it should, meaning that users will lose out on the rewards. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`migrateUser` in `TrufVesting` calls `migrateVestingLock` as in the below snippet, in the event the user has locked staked funds:

```solidity
if (lockupId != 0) {
  newLockupId = veTRUF.migrateVestingLock(prevUser, newUser, lockupId - 1) + 1;
  lockupIds[categoryId][vestingId][newUser] = newLockupId;
  delete lockupIds[categoryId][vestingId][prevUser];
  
  newVesting.locked = prevVesting.locked;
}
```

And migrateVestingLock looks like this:

```solidity
function migrateVestingLock(address oldUser, address newUser, uint256 lockupId)
  external
  onlyVesting
  returns (uint256 newLockupId)
{
        if (oldUser == newUser) {
            revert NotMigrate();
        }
        if (newUser == address(0)) {
            revert ZeroAddress();
        }
        Lockup memory oldLockup = lockups[oldUser][lockupId];
        if (!oldLockup.isVesting) {
            revert NoAccess();
        }

        uint256 points = oldLockup.points;
        stakingRewards.withdraw(oldUser, points);
        _burn(oldUser, points);

        newLockupId = lockups[newUser].length;
        lockups[newUser].push(oldLockup);
        _mint(newUser, points);
        stakingRewards.stake(newUser, points);

        delete lockups[oldUser][lockupId];

        emit Migrated(oldUser, newUser, lockupId, newLockupId);
}
```

This function will withdraw staking points from the old user and give them to the new one. However, there may be a bunch of unclaimed rewards (represented by the `rewards` mapping) in `VirtualStakingRewards`, which should also be migrated (otherwise the user will lose out on these rewards, as they cannot claim due to a loss of private key). 

## Impact

User will lose staking rewards

Also migrate staking rewards, not just points
