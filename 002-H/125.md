# User migration does not migrate unclaimed rewards

## Summary

Even if a user hasn't yet called [`VotingEscrowTruf.claimReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/VotingEscrowTruf.sol#L254-L259), [`migrateUser()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L310) does not migrate the user's unclaimed rewards


## Vulnerability Detail

The `TrufVesting` contract, which manages the vesting of token ownership, has a function whose specific task is to allow users to migrate everything to a new address if they [lose their private key](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L303). The function migrates a user's vesting schedule and escrow locks to a new address, but does not migrate the user's earned unclaimed rewards.


## Impact

A user's unclaimed rewards will remain locked in the reward contract, even after the user migration occurs.


## Code Snippet

The amount the user claimed as well as the user's locks get migrated, but the user's [reward balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol#L126-L127) doesn't get transferred:
```solidity
// File: src/token/TrufVesting.sol : TrufVesting.migrateUser()   #1

321            newVesting.amount = prevVesting.amount;
322 @>         newVesting.claimed = prevVesting.claimed;
323            newVesting.startTime = prevVesting.startTime;
324    
325            uint256 lockupId = lockupIds[categoryId][vestingId][prevUser];
326            uint256 newLockupId;
327    
328            if (lockupId != 0) {
329:@>             newLockupId = veTRUF.migrateVestingLock(prevUser, newUser, lockupId - 1) + 1;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Add a `migrateUnclaimedBalance()` function to `VirtualStakingRewards`, and have `VotingEscrowTruf` call it when `migrateUser()` is called.
