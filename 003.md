# User can extend their expired lock and get free ve balance

## Summary
User can extend their expired lock and get free ve balance 

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the VotingEscrow contract, the users can extend their locks in order to accumulate higher balance within the contract. However a major difference is made from the usual VotingEscrow implementation and the `VotingEscrowTruf` allows users to extend even their expired locks. In fact they can do so with the new expire time still being in the past.

Users who already have expired locks can extend them and get higher ve balance even without actually locking their tokens for any longer 

```solidity
    function _unstake(address user, uint256 lockupId, bool isVesting, bool force) internal returns (uint256 amount) {
        Lockup memory lockup = lockups[user][lockupId];
        if (lockup.isVesting != isVesting) {
            revert NoAccess();
        }
        amount = lockup.amount;
        uint256 end = lockup.end;
        uint256 points = lockup.points;
        if (end == 0) {
            revert LockupAlreadyUnstaked();
        }
        if (!force && block.timestamp < end) {
            revert LockupNotEnded();
        }
        delete lockups[user][lockupId]; // Keeps empty in array, so indexes are stable

        stakingRewards.withdraw(user, points);
        _burn(user, points);
        trufToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount); // Sender is msg.sender

        emit Unstake(user, isVesting, lockupId, amount, end, points);

        if (block.timestamp < end) {
            emit Cancelled(user, lockupId, amount, points);
        }
    }
```


## Impact
Users with already expired locks can accumulate higher ve balance for no cost.
