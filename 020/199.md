# constructor of ownable contract is not called with the constructor of TrufVesting.sol and VirtualStaking rewards contract

## Summary
Owner is not set along with the constructor of some contract


## Vulnerability Detail
following is the constructor of TrufVesting contract 
```solidity
constructor(IERC20 _trufToken, uint64 _tgeTime) {
        if (address(_trufToken) == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

        trufToken = _trufToken;

        if (_tgeTime < block.timestamp) {
            revert InvalidTimestamp();
        }
        tgeTime = _tgeTime;
    }
```
You can see there is no ownable constructor initialised therefore no owner is initiliased
Similarly it can be seen in the Virtual Staking rewards contract


## Impact
Can cause error in onlyOwner modifier

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Intiialise the ownable constructor as follows in both the contracts
```solidity
constructor(IERC20 _trufToken, uint64 _tgeTime) Ownable(owner) {
        if (address(_trufToken) == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

        trufToken = _trufToken;

        if (_tgeTime < block.timestamp) {
            revert InvalidTimestamp();
        }
        tgeTime = _tgeTime;
    }
```
