# Reentrancy Vulnerability in VotingEscrowTruf._stake

## Summary
This report addresses a critical reentrancy vulnerability discovered in the `_stake` function of the `VotingEscrowTruf` contract. This vulnerability poses a potential security risk, enabling unexpected contract behavior due to external calls preceding state updates.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is located in the `_stake` method of the `VotingEscrowTruf` contract. It involves making external calls before updating the contract's state variables, leading to a potential reentrancy attack.

- **Contract**: `VotingEscrowTruf`
- **Function**: `_stake(uint256, uint256, address, bool)`
- **Location**: `VotingEscrowTruf.sol` - Lines [137-176](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/VotingEscrowTruf.sol#L137-L176)

## Impact
This vulnerability allows for potential reentrant calls, enabling attackers to execute functions or alter contract states in unintended ways. It can lead to financial losses, governance issues, or other malicious activities within the contract ecosystem.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, uint256 duration, address to, bool isVesting) internal returns (uint256 lockupId) {
        if (to == address(0)) {
            revert ZeroAddress();
        }
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmount();
        }
        if (amount > type(uint128).max) {
            revert InvalidAmount();
        }

        // duration checked inside previewPoints
        (uint256 points, uint256 end) = previewPoints(amount, duration);
        if (points + totalSupply() > type(uint192).max) {
            revert MaxPointsExceeded();
        }

        lockups[to].push(
            Lockup({
                amount: uint128(amount), // max checked in require above
                duration: uint128(duration),
                end: uint128(end),
                points: points,
                isVesting: isVesting
            })
        );

        trufToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); // Important that it's sender

        stakingRewards.stake(to, points);
        _mint(to, points);

        if (delegates(to) == address(0)) {
            // Delegate voting power to the receiver, if unregistered
            _delegate(to, to);
        }

        lockupId = lockups[to].length - 1;
        emit Stake(to, isVesting, lockupId, amount, end, points);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risk of this vulnerability:
1. **State Updates First**: Reorder the function to ensure all state updates occur before external calls.
2. **Implement Reentrancy Guards**: Employ reentrancy guards such as OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent unauthorized external calls during critical function executions.
3. **Code Review and Testing**: Conduct thorough code reviews and comprehensive testing to ensure that the contract logic is resistant to reentrancy attacks.
