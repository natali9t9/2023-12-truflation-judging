# setEmissionSchedule function doesn't allow owner to remove schedule

## Summary
`setEmissionSchedule` function doesn't allow owner to remove schedule, so once it is set, then owner can't remove it.
## Vulnerability Detail
`TrufVesting.setEmissionSchedule` allows owner to provide emission schedule for the category. It is allowed to call function several times [before tge reached](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L440-L442] to allow owner to change settings.

But the function [doesn't allow to provide empty array](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L446C13-L446C34), which means that once owner has initiated emission schedule, then he can't remove it.

If we look into `getEmission` function, then we will see, that in case if emission schedule is empty, then [`maxAllocation` is returned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L569), otherwise [allocation will be vested](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L585-L586).
## Impact
Once owner provided emission schedule, he doesn't have ability to remove it and make all allocation to be used from the beginning.
