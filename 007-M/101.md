# First Depositor can stake dust to earn substantive rewards

## Summary
Traditional first depositor issue where someone can stake deposit 1 WEI to effect the total supply and reward calculations, and then after the 1 hour stake obtain substantive rewards.

The first depositor is responsible for setting the initial total supply, which impacts the initial setting of the global RPT (RewardPerToken). If the total supply is 1 WEI, then the RPT difference is the greatest, and 1 WEI will earn some token rewards. If the initial `rewardRate` set by the admin for the first 7 days of staking rewards is not a trivial amount compared to the total token supply of 1 billion (0.01% or more), and the 2nd staker takes any length of time greater than a few seconds to stake after the first depositor, then substantive rewards can be earned by the first depositor's 1 WEI stake.

"Users can get tokens after TGE (token generation event) time, we will notifyRewardAmount after TGE time as well when some of our staking rewards tokens vested. Users can get tokens from vesting or liquidity." So it seems possible for a malicious Alice to get tokens to be the first depositor.

## Vulnerability Detail
**Admin**: Calls `notifyRewardAmount(amount)`. The amount passed in is arbitrary, set to 100e18 in tests but this seems very small for a 7 day reward period compared to the 1,000,000,000e18 total supply. For this specific walkthrough, we assume the first 7 day rewards for staking are 1,000,000e18, or 0.1% of the total supply. For the first call to `notifyRewardAmount()`, all the global state variables are 0.
Therefore, the admin gets the ball rolling with `notifyRewardAmount()` and we calculate:
* `rewardRate` = 1,000,000e18 / (86400 * 7) = 1.65e18
* `lastUpdateTime` = 1,700,000,000 (1.7B) (current block.timestamp example)
* `periodFinish` = 1.7B + 7 days in seconds = 1,700,604,800

**Alice as the 1st Depositor Staker:**
Alice calls `VotingEscrowTruf.stake(amount, duration)` passing in 26,280 WEI for 3,600 seconds (minimum stake duration). We pass in 26,280 WEI because this converts to 1 virtual staking point. Inside `VotingEscrowTruf.previewPoint()` we see calculation for amount of points, we want 1 WEI:  `points = amount * duration / MAX_DURATION;` --> `1 = X * 3,600 / 94,608,000` --> X = 26,280.

So Alice stakes 1 point via `VirtualStakingRewards.stake()`. The `updateReward` modifier is called, which sets the RPT to 0 because the `_totalSupply` is 0 and the `rewardPerTokenStored` is 0. The `lastUpdateTime` is set to 1.7B+2, assuming Alice stakes 2 seconds after the call to `notifyRewardAmount()` at 1.7B. Importantly, Alice's `userRewardPerTokenPaid` is set to 0 for her account, and currently has 0 rewards earned via `earned()` because her balance is still 0 since the `stake()` function hasn't finished. The `stake()` function then finishes setting `_totalSupply` = 1, and Alice's balance to 1.

**Bob as the 2nd Staker**:
Bob stakes 100e18 points 5 minutes later. This re-calculates the RPT to increase from 0 to 4.95e38. Bob essentially sets the RPT in stone, as now it will never change that much because the total supply has increased to a normal amount from 1 wei to 100e18+1.
`RPT = (0 + (1.7B+302 - 1.7B+2) * 1.65e18 * 1e18) / 1`  = `300 * 1.65e18 * 1e18 / 1` = 4.95e38. The `lastUpdateTime` = 1.7B+302. The `_totalSupply` = 100e18+1.

**Charlie as the 3rd+ Staker**:
Charlie can represent many stakers who continue to stake and increase the total supply, and marginally increase the RPT by very small amounts. For example, Charlie stake 500e18 points after 10 minutes (600 seconds), the RPT is now:

RPT = 4.95e38 + ((600 * 1.65e18 * 1e18) / (100e18 + 1)) = 4.95e38 + 9.9e18. Notice how small the RPT changed. The time that Charlie(s) stakes and the current total supply are virtually irrelevant when we want to focus on how much the first depositor is going to earn. The only thing that mattered to Alice is the `rewardRate` and the `time` distance during Bob's stake. `lastUpdateTime` = 1.7B+902. `_totalSupply` = 600e18+1.

**Alice Unstakes 1 WEI**: 
After her stake of 1 hour matures, she can unstake via `VotingEscrowTruf.unstake(lockupId)`. She passes in her lockupId, `_unstake()` is called, which calls `VirtualStakingRewards.withdraw()` with her 1 point. The RPT is now:

RPT = (4.95e38 + 9.9e18) + ((1.7B+3602-1.7B+902) * 1.65e18 * 1e18) / (600e18 + 1) = 4.95e38 + 1.73e19. `lastUpdateTime` = 1.7B+3602. (Notice it barely changes again).

Her rewards are calculated through `earned()`: (1 * (4.95e38 + 1.73e19 - 0) / (1e18 + 0)) = 4.95e20 = 495 tokens. Importantly she gets so many rewards because the RPT is very high, but her `userRewardPerTokenPaid` is 0 because she was the first depositor. She can now call `VotingEscrowTruf.claimReward()` which calls `VirtualStakingReward.getReward()` and gives her the 495 `rewardsToken`. 

## PoC
Inside `VirtualStakingRewards.t.sol`, run with: `forge test --mt testWithdraw_FirstDepositorMakesMoneyWithDust`
```diff
// add charlie
+    address public charlie;
     function setUp() public {
+        charlie = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Charlie")))));
     }

+    vm.label(charlie, "Charlie");
```

```javascript
    function testWithdraw_FirstDepositorMakesMoneyWithDust() external {
        uint256 rewardAmount = 1_000_000e18; 
        _notifyReward(rewardAmount);

        uint256 aliceAmount = 1; // 1 wei
        uint256 bobAmount = 100e18;
        uint256 charlieAmount = 500e18;

        vm.startPrank(operator);
        
        // Alice stakes immediately after _notifyReward() and is the first depositor
        trufStakingRewards.stake(alice, aliceAmount); 

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 300); // Bob stakes 5 minutes later
        trufStakingRewards.stake(bob, bobAmount);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 600); // Charlie stakes 10 minutes later
        trufStakingRewards.stake(charlie, charlieAmount);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 hours - 900); // Alice unstakes after the 1 hour minimum

        vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true, address(trufStakingRewards));
        emit Withdrawn(alice, aliceAmount);

        trufStakingRewards.withdraw(alice, aliceAmount);

        assertEq(trufStakingRewards.rewards(alice), 496031746031746031717); // ⚠️496e18 free tokens for Alice⚠️
        assertEq(trufStakingRewards.earned(alice), 496031746031746031717); // 496e18 free tokens for Alice
        assertEq(trufStakingRewards.userRewardPerTokenPaid(alice), 496031746031746031717361111111111111108);// RPT for Alice is 4.96e38
        assertEq(trufStakingRewards.rewardPerTokenStored(), 496031746031746031717361111111111111108);// RPT is 4.96e38

        // Other miscellaneous checks
        assertEq(trufStakingRewards.totalSupply(), bobAmount + charlieAmount, "Total supply is invalid");
        assertEq(trufStakingRewards.balanceOf(alice), 0, "Balance is invalid");
        assertEq(trufStakingRewards.lastUpdateTime(), block.timestamp, "Last updated time is invalid");

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It must be ensured that the total supply should never increase from 0 to very small amounts like 1 WEI. 
* Consider setting the initial `_totalSupply` to 10e18 instead of 0.
* Consider having a minimum stake deposit amount of 1e18, or deposit 10e18 as the first staker yourselves to thwart first depositor issues. (Make sure it's batched with the first call of `notifyRewardAmount()`). 
* Consider making sure the `_totalSupply`, once non-zero, can never go back to near-zero 1 WEI amounts, with a minimum check of 1e18 or something once the balance is non-zero. This can be achieved by not allowing users to unstake if it would bring the `_totalSupply` to anything less than 1e18 or something.
