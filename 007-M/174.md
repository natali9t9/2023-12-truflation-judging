# Unfair reward calculation in `VirtualStakingRewards` contract

## Summary
Early user can get more rewards compared to later users , they have different incentive distribution rates .

## Vulnerability Detail
When early user get into the StakingPool, the  `_totalSupply` is smaller , so the `rewardRate = totalRewards / _totalSupply` is very high, early user can get much more token rewards .

## Impact
Influence the fairness of the Staking mechanism .

## Code Snippet

user's rewards calculation
```solidity
   modifier updateReward(address account) {
        rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
        lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable();
        if (account != address(0)) {
            rewards[account] = earned(account);
            userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
        _;
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol#L87-L93
```solidity
 function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
        return
            rewardPerTokenStored + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / _totalSupply);
    }
```

```solidity
 function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward) external onlyRewardsDistribution updateReward(address(0)) {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possible way to solve these problems is to take into account the user's staking time and amount, as well as the start and end of the reward period when calculating rewards
