# VotingEscrowTruf contract doesn't inherits the erc20 permit

## Summary
Voting escrow truf is not inheriting erc20 permit contract but it is initialising it in the constructor

## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see from the following that the constructor of votingEscrow truf is initialising erc20 permit
```solidity
 constructor(address _trufToken, address _trufVesting, uint256 _minStakeDuration, address _stakingRewards)
        ERC20("Voting Escrowed TRUF", "veTRUF")
        ERC20Permit("veTRUF")
    {
        trufToken = IERC20(_trufToken);
        trufVesting = _trufVesting;
        minStakeDuration = _minStakeDuration;
        stakingRewards = IVirtualStakingRewards(_stakingRewards);
    }
```
But the contract is not inheriting erc20 permit as can be seen from the following 
```solidity
contract VotingEscrowTruf is ERC20Votes, IVotingEscrow
```

## Impact
It can lead to unexpected behaviour and a user might not be able to allow the spender using the signature method
