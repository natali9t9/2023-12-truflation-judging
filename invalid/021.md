# View "getRewardForDuration" could provide wrong data

## Summary
The "getRewardForDuration" view function may yield inaccurate data, potentially influencing erroneous decisions for the consumers of this view.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ["getRewardForDuration"](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol#L100) view provides information about potential rewards that may be available. However, if the specified time period has ended, when "block.timestamp >= periodFinish," the "getRewardForDuration" function may yield an inaccurate reward value. In these instances, no reward is currently accessible as the "notifyRewardAmount" has not been invoked (yet).

## Impact
The code under review itself does not use the view ""getRewardForDuration", however consumers of the view "getRewardForDuration" make wrong decisions based on wrong provided reward data.

## Code Snippet
None. See link above.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider revising the "getRewardForDuration" view to accurately reflect the data when the period has concluded. 

For example, the view could be modified as follows:

```solidity
function getRewardForDuration() external view returns (uint256) {
    if (block.timestamp > periodFinish) {
        return 0;
    }

    return rewardRate * rewardsDuration;
}
```
