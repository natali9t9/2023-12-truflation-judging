# contracts may not be able to claim new TRUF token after migration

## Summary
to receive the new TRUF token, address should call `TrufMigrator.migrate()`. the issue is that contracts that owns TFI tokens and their balance is captured in the merkle tree, may not have logics to call `migrate()` function and `migrate()`'s logic doesn't allow 3rd party to call it for other addresses. so those contract will lose their TFI tokens and won't receive new TRUF tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `migrate()` code:
```javascript
    function migrate(uint256 index, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof) external {
        bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encode(msg.sender, index, amount));

        if (MerkleProof.verify(proof, merkleRoot, leaf) == false) {
            revert InvalidProof();
        }

        uint256 _migratedAmount = migratedAmount[msg.sender];

        if (amount <= _migratedAmount) {
            revert AlreadyMigrated();
        }

        migratedAmount[msg.sender] = amount;

        uint256 migrateAmount = amount - _migratedAmount;
        trufToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, migrateAmount);

        emit Migrated(msg.sender, migrateAmount);
    }
```
as you can see it can only callable by `msg.sender` to migrate the `msg.sender` tokens. so if a contract owns TFI tokens and wants to receive TRUF token it requires to have logics that calls `migrate()` itself. there is no guarantee that contracts have this logic as they didn't know that TRI is going to be upgraded to TRUF and those contract would lose their funds and won't be able to receive TRUF tokens.

## Impact
contracts who own TFI tokens won't be able to receive TRUF token by calling `migrate()`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
allow anyone call `migrate()` for any address. as there is no risk in receiving the TRUF token when others call `migrate()`. this way contract owners can call `migrate()` for their contracts.
