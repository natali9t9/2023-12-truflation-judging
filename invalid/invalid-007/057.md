# Token Supply:

## Summary
Token Supply: The comment states that the total supply should be 100,000,000 TRUF, but the _mint function actually mints 1,000,000,000e18 (which is one billion with 18 decimal places), indicating a potential discrepancy between the intended supply and the implemented supply. This could be a critical error if not intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
        _mint(msg.sender, 1_000_000_000e18);

## Impact
 the _mint function actually mints 1,000,000,000e18 (which is one billion with 18 decimal places), indicating a potential discrepancy between the intended supply and the implemented supply. This could be a critical error if not intended.
