# Lack of Vesting Existence Check in migrateUser Function

## Summary
The `migrateUser` function in the provided Solidity contract lacks a check to ensure that the user being migrated (`prevUser`) has existing vesting information for the specified category and vesting ID. The absence of this check may lead to unintended behavior when attempting to migrate a user without vesting information, potentially allowing migration in scenarios where it should be restricted.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `migrateUser` function, the code checks if the new user (`newUser`) already has vesting information for the specified category and vesting ID. However, it does not explicitly verify whether the user being migrated (`prevUser`) has existing vesting information. The lack of this check may result in the migration of a user without vesting information, leading to unexpected behavior.
```solidity
/**
 * @notice Migrate owner of vesting. Used when user lost his private key
 * @dev Only admin can migrate users vesting
 * @param categoryId Category id
 * @param vestingId Vesting id
 * @param prevUser previous user address
 * @param newUser new user address
 */
function migrateUser(uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, address prevUser, address newUser) external onlyOwner {
    UserVesting storage prevVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][prevUser];
    UserVesting storage newVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][newUser];

    if (newVesting.amount != 0) {
        revert UserVestingAlreadySet(categoryId, vestingId, newUser);
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}
```
## Impact
The lack of a check for existing vesting information on the user being migrated may allow unintended migration of users without vesting, potentially leading to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior in the contract's state.

## Recommendation
Implement a check to verify that the user being migrated (`prevUser`) has existing vesting information for the specified category and vesting ID before proceeding with the migration.
