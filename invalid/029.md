# Incorrect Use of Bitwise-XOR in OpenZeppelin's Math.mulDiv Function

## Title: Incorrect Use of Bitwise-XOR in OpenZeppelin's Math.mulDiv Function

## Summary
An error in coding has been identified in the OpenZeppelin's `Math.mulDiv` function, specifically located in the `Math.sol` library. This error involves the misuse of the bitwise-xor operator (`^`) instead of the intended exponentiation operator (`**`), leading to inaccurate computational results.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is found in the line `inverse = (3 * denominator) ^ 2` within the `Math.mulDiv` function. This line is intended to perform an exponentiation operation - squaring the product of 3 and the `denominator`. However, it incorrectly employs the bitwise-xor operator, which executes a bit-by-bit logical XOR operation, thus deviating from the expected mathematical computation.

## Impact
The incorrect use of the bitwise-xor operator can lead to significant miscalculations, especially in scenarios where `mulDiv` is pivotal for financial transactions or critical contract logic. This could potentially result in erroneous token distributions, reward calculations, or other financial computations, thereby impacting the overall integrity and functionality of the contract.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// Incorrect operation in OpenZeppelin's Math.sol
inverse = (3 * denominator) ^ 2;

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Immediate rectification of the code is advised. The bitwise-xor operator (`^`) should be replaced with the exponentiation operator (`**`) to ensure accurate calculations. Post-correction, a comprehensive review and testing of all contracts relying on this function are crucial. Additionally, an audit of other dependencies and sections of the codebase is recommended to rule out similar issues. Implementing these changes will safeguard the contracts from computational inaccuracies stemming from this error.
