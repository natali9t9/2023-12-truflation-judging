# TrufMigrator migrate can lead to loss of airdrop for user

## Summary
Implementation of 'migrate' will lead to loss of user airdrop in some cases. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume user has claimed some airdrop of value X from contract. 

Then if 
1) they also has airdrop Y where Y<X, they won't be able to claim the airdrop. 
2) owner has added new 'merkleRoot' to contract and user can claim Y, where Y<X

user won't be able to claim it due to code on line 57 

## Impact
HIGH - potential loss of user airdrop funds.
