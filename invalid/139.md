# Unsafe Downcasting in `_stake` Function from `uint256` to `uint128`

## Summary
The `_stake` function in the `VotingEscrowTruf` contract potentially introduces unsafe downcasting, as it attempts to downcast the amount variable to `uint12`8 without sufficient validation, which could lead to loss of data or precision.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_stake` function, the amount variable is explicitly cast to `uint128` during the creation of a Lockup struct:
```solidity
Lockup({
    amount: uint128(amount), // max checked in require above
    duration: uint128(duration),
    end: uint128(end),
    points: points,
    isVesting: isVesting
})
```
While the code includes a check` amount > type(uint128).max` to prevent integer overflow, the downcasting itself can still introduce risks. If amount exceeds the maximum value representable by `uint128`, the downcast will truncate the value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
## Impact
The unsafe downcasting operation in the `_stake` function has the potential to truncate the user's input when casting the `amount` variable to `uint128`. If a user attempts to stake an amount that exceeds the maximum value representable by `uint128`, the downcast will result in the loss of the higher-order bits of the amount.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend the project handle downcasting and use safe casting library to make sure the downcast does not provide an unexpected truncate value.
