# Rewards Handling and Potential Reentrancy

## Summary
The contract lacks proper token transfer logic in the withdraw function, which may prevent users from receiving their rewards. Additionally, there's a potential reentrancy risk and a concern about the handling of small amounts.


## Vulnerability Detail

-  Missing Token Transfer: The withdraw function updates balances but lacks token transfer logic, potentially preventing users from receiving their rewards.
-  Reentrancy Risk: Depending on the contract's structure, the withdraw function might pose a reentrancy risk by interacting with external contracts after modifying state variables.
-  Handling Small Amounts: The code does not handle small amounts, which could lead to precision errors or unexpected behavior in financial calculations.

## Impact
The current issues might prevent users from properly withdrawing their rewards or could lead to unexpected behavior in handling balances and calculations, affecting the correctness and user experience of the contract.

```solidity
function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) public updateReward(user) onlyOperator {
    if (amount == 0) {
        revert ZeroAmount();
    }
    _totalSupply -= amount;
    _balances[user] -= amount;
    emit Withdrawn(user, amount);
    // Missing token transfer logic here
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

-  Implement proper token transfer logic within the withdraw function to allow users to receive their rewards securely.
-  Ensure that all state changes are completed before any external calls to avoid potential reentrancy issues.
-  Consider handling small amounts to prevent precision errors or unexpected behavior in calculations involving tokens and rewards.
