# rewardRate can be zero

## Summary
reward rate will be zero if rewardsDuration will be to much larger.
## Vulnerability Detail
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward) external onlyRewardsDistribution updateReward(address(0)) {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
        }

## Impact
if rewardRate is zero then reward will be effected.
