# `exit(address user)` in `VirualStakingReward.sol` cannot be executed if user has staked amount

## Summary
The `exit` function in `VirualStakingReward.sol` cannot be executed successfully if "_balances[user]!=0"
## Vulnerability Detail
`exit` in `VirualStakingReward.sol` is marked as external and can be called by anyone. However it calls `withdraw` which can be only accessed by the operator, which is the `VotingEscrowTruf` contract. If Alice stakes any tokens and calls `exit`, the transaction will revert, as Alice is not the operator.
`VotingEscrowTruf.sol` does not have any function calling `exit`, so it cannot be called. 
This was not caught in the tests as they are using `vm.startPrank(operator)`.

## Impact
Any attempt of calling `exit` passing a user with staked amount will result in a failure. It will only work for users who unstaked their amount and are using it instead of using `getReward`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a onlyOperator modifier for the `exit` function in `VirualStakingReward.sol` and add a function in `VotingEscrowTruf.sol`, which calls `exit` so that the `msg.sender` will be the`VotingEscrowTruf`contract.
