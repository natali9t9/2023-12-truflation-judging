# Centralization Risk:

## Summary
Centralization Risk: The ccipPool has the power to mint and burn tokens, which is a highly centralized point of control. If the ccipPool is compromised, the attacker could inflate the token supply or burn tokens at will.
Owner Privileges: This is another point of centralization that could be abused if the owner's account is compromised.The contract owner has the ability to change the ccipPool address. This is another point of centralization that could be abused if the owner's account is compromised.
## Vulnerability Detail
function setCcipPool(address _ccipPool) external onlyOwner {
        if (_ccipPool == address(0)) {
            revert ZeroAddress();
        }

        ccipPool = _ccipPool;

        emit CcipPoolSet(_ccipPool);



## Impact
This is another point of centralization that could be abused if the owner's account is compromised
if the ccipPool is compromised, the attacker could inflate the token supply or burn tokens at will.
