# No Double-Claim Protection

## Summary
No Double-Claim Protection: The contract checks if the claimed amount is less than or equal to the already migrated amount, which prevents double claims. However, it does not prevent a user from claiming less than their total amount multiple times until they reach their total balance. This could potentially be used to game airdrops or other mechanisms that rely on the migration status.

## Vulnerability Detail
  bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encode(msg.sender, index, amount));

        if (MerkleProof.verify(proof, merkleRoot, leaf) == false) {
            revert InvalidProof();
        }

        uint256 _migratedAmount = migratedAmount[msg.sender];

        if (amount <= _migratedAmount) {
            revert AlreadyMigrated();
        }

        migratedAmount[msg.sender] = amount;

        uint256 migrateAmount = amount - _migratedAmount;
        trufToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, migrateAmount);

        emit Migrated(msg.sender, migrateAmount);
