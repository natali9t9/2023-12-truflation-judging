# 'VirtualStakingRewards.setRewardsDuration' allows setting near zero or enormous `rewardsDuration`, which breaks reward logic

## Summary
The owner can set the rewards duration to a number near zero or a very big number and break the contract's logic.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `VirtualStakingRewards.sol`, the function `setRewardsDuration` allows the owner to put any number as a parameter. There is no check for the input if it is too small or too big. The setter does not control the value, allowing zero/near zero/enormous duration.
## Impact
Division by the duration is used in `notifyRewardAmount`, which will break the contract's logic if an improper value is passed thus I will label this as medium.

## Recommendation
Check for min and max range in the rewardsDuration setter, as too small or too big `_rewardsDuration` breaks the logic.
