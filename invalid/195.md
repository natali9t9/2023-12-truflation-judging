# Centralized Control and Single Point of Failure in TrufVesting

## Summary
The contract is designed for managing token vesting and the problem  arising from its centralized control structure so the contract places a high degree of control in the hands of the owner, creating a single point of failure.
And  The owner can modify key aspects of the vesting process, including setting user vesting, cancelling vesting, and migrating users.
## Vulnerability Detail
See the summary and let’s say ans example of attack:

Let’s Suppose the owner account is compromised.
As a Action: The attacker uses cancelVesting for a user, user1, with parameters (categoryId, vestingId, user1, true).
- This action would stop user1's vesting process and potentially distribute any unclaimed tokens to user1 immediately, regardless of the intended vesting schedule.

## Impact
If the owner's private keys are stolen or the account is otherwise compromised, it could lead to significant financial loss for users

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
It’s need to Replace single owner control with a multi-signature mechanism to distribute decision-making power.
