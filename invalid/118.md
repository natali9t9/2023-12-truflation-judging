# The extendStaking function in the TrufVesting.sol contract lacks a timestamp validation check

## Summary
The extendStaking function in the TrufVesting.sol contract lacks a timestamp validation check, which may result in unexpected behavior if the duration is incorrectly set to a negative value.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability in the TrufVesting.sol contract's extendStaking function exposes a potential risk due to the absence of a timestamp validation check. This function allows users to extend the staking period for their tokens in the veTRUF contract. However, the lack of a timestamp validation check opens up the possibility for users to provide a negative duration, leading to unexpected and undesirable consequences.

When a user invokes the extendStaking function, the provided duration parameter represents the additional time the staking period should be extended. Without a proper timestamp validation, a user could set a negative duration, resulting in a scenario where the staking lock period appears to be in the past. This manipulation might lead to unexpected behavior in the veTRUF contract, as it extends the staking lock based on the given duration.

In practical terms, this vulnerability could be exploited by malicious actors to trick the system into extending staking periods incorrectly. For instance, a user might attempt to exploit this by providing a negative duration that extends the staking lock back in time, potentially affecting calculations related to staking rewards, voting power, or other associated functionalities.

The impact of this vulnerability could include disruptions in the expected behavior of the staking mechanism, leading to inaccurate reward calculations, unexpected voting power changes, or other anomalies that could compromise the integrity of the contract. Additionally, such unexpected behavior could be leveraged for abuse or manipulation, posing risks to the overall security and functionality of the TrufVesting contract.

To address this vulnerability, it is crucial to implement a timestamp validation check in the extendStaking function. This check should ensure that the calculated expiration time, considering the provided duration, does not result in a timestamp earlier than the current block timestamp. By validating the timestamp, the contract can mitigate the risk of incorrect staking period extensions and enhance the overall security and reliability of the staking functionality.


## Impact
Assuming a malicious user exploits the lack of timestamp validation in the extendStaking function in the TrufVesting.sol contract. Under normal circumstances, a user can legitimately use the function to extend the staking period. However, the absence of timestamp validation opens the door to potential attacks.

A malicious user manipulates the timestamp by passing a negative duration parameter. For instance, this can be achieved by manipulating the transaction to decrease the value of block.timestamp.

```solidity
// Maliciously passed negative duration
extendStaking(categoryId, vestingId, -3600); // Let's assume this is an hour in seconds
```
Under normal conditions, the function should reject attempts to extend staking by a negative time. However, the current implementation lacks this verification. This results in the extension of staking by an hour backward, leading to several potentially harmful scenarios:

**Loss of Funds:** A user can initiate a staking extension with a negative time, causing a loss of funds from the staking pool. Since staking is associated with token lockup, the attacker could gain access to funds that should normally remain locked.

**Emission Manipulation:** By introducing negative time, the attacker can manipulate emission and gain unjustified access to new tokens that would normally be available in the future.

**Ecosystem Disruption:** An attacker could intentionally introduce chaos into the ecosystem by providing incorrect staking data, leading to a loss of trust in the platform.

**Unexpected Consequences:** Lack of timestamp validation may lead to unpredictable outcomes, such as incorrect staking calculations, an inability to return funds after the staking period, or even a systemic rewards error.

In summary, the absence of timestamp validation in the extendStaking function opens the door to various attack scenarios that can result in a loss of funds, emission manipulation, ecosystem disruption, and unpredictable consequences for platform users. Implementing proper time-based verifications is crucial to securing the contract against potential threats.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address the vulnerability in the extendStaking function, it is crucial to include proper timestamp validation. Here's an improved version of the code with the recommended modification:
```solidity
// Add a check for valid timestamp
function extendStaking(uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, uint256 duration) external {
    uint256 lockupId = lockupIds[categoryId][vestingId][msg.sender];
    if (lockupId == 0) {
        revert LockDoesNotExist();
    }

    // Check for valid timestamp
    if (block.timestamp + duration < block.timestamp) {
        revert InvalidTimestamp();
    }

    veTRUF.extendVestingLock(msg.sender, lockupId - 1, duration);

    emit ExtendedStaking(categoryId, vestingId, msg.sender, duration);
}
```
In this modified version, a check has been added to ensure that the calculated timestamp for the staking extension is valid. The condition if (block.timestamp + duration < block.timestamp) verifies that the resulting timestamp after extending the staking duration is not in the past, preventing manipulation of the extension by passing a negative duration.

By incorporating this check, the code now guards against potential timestamp manipulation and ensures the security and integrity of the staking extension functionality.
