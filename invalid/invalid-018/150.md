# MaxPoints can be exceeded using extendLock

## Summary

The `VotingEscrowTruf` contract, designed to manage voting power through `ERC20Votes` tokens, has a vulnerability in its token supply limit enforcement. The contract fails to adequately check for the maximum token supply limit in the `_extendLock()` function, which could lead to an unintended inflation of the total votes beyond the intended maximum.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract is programmed to ensure that the total supply of tokens does not exceed `type(uint192).max`, as enforced in the `_stake()` function:

```solidity
if (points + totalSupply() > type(uint192).max) {
	revert MaxPointsExceeded();
}
```

However, this safeguard is absent in the `_extendLock()` function, which is responsible for minting new tokens without checking the total supply against the maximum limit:

```solidity
function _extendLock(address user, uint256 lockupId, uint256 duration, bool isVesting) internal {
	...
	//No checks for max here

	stakingRewards.stake(user, mintAmount);
	_mint(user, mintAmount);

	emit Unstake(user, isVesting, lockupId, amount, oldEnd, oldPoints);
	emit Stake(user, isVesting, lockupId, amount, newEnd, newPoints);
}
```

This oversight allows the possibility of exceeding the maximum token supply limit during the lock extension process.

## Impact

This issue leads to a possible inflation of the `totalVotes` over the intended maximum of `type(uint192).max`. If this maximum is hardcoded in an external voting contract, a user could inflate the totalVotes far over this barrier, and potentially pass proposals without the needed percentage of votes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this vulnerability, the `_extendLock()` function should include a check for the total token supply limit before minting new tokens to the user, similar to the check in `_stake()`:

```solidity
if (mintAmount + totalSupply() > type(uint192).max) {
	revert MaxPointsExceeded();
}
```

Implementing this change will safeguard the contract against exceeding the maximum token supply, thus maintaining the integrity of the voting system and ensuring that proposals are passed based on genuine consensus.
