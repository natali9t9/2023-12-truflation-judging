# Contract Identification

## Summary
Contract Identification: The code uses Address.isContract to check if the recipient is a contract. This check is reliable post-construction, but it should be noted that during the construction phase of a contract, this check would return false.
## Vulnerability Detail
if (Address.isContract(_to)) {
            _contractFallback(_to, _value, _data);
        }
