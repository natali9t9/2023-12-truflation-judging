# Lack of Overflow Protection in the earned Function

## Summary
In the earned function of the VirtualStakingRewards contract, there is a potential vulnerability related to integer overflow.
## Vulnerability Detail

During a thorough manual review of the VirtualStakingRewards contract within the Truflation project, a potential vulnerability related to integer overflow was identified. Specifically, the earned function lacks adequate overflow protection, which may pose a risk to the stability and security of the smart contract.

The earned function, responsible for calculating user rewards, performs a multiplication operation involving _balances[account] and (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]). Without proper overflow protection, these values, if exceptionally large, could lead to an integer overflow issue.
## Impact
**Loss of Accuracy in Reward Calculations:**
The vulnerability could result in a loss of accuracy in the computation of user rewards. In scenarios where _balances[account] and rewardPerToken() values are excessively high, the multiplication operation may exceed the maximum representable integer, leading to an overflow. This, in turn, may compromise the fairness and accuracy of reward distributions.

**Potential Exploitation for Manipulation:**
Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the reward calculation mechanism. By deliberately staking large amounts, an attacker might trigger integer overflows, resulting in inflated or even undeserved rewards. This has the potential to undermine the intended economic incentives of the staking system.

**Disruption of User Experience:**
In extreme cases, integer overflows could lead to unexpected behavior, disrupting the overall user experience and eroding trust in the staking mechanism. Users relying on the platform for staking rewards may experience inconsistencies and inaccuracies in their expected returns.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a situation where a user with an exceptionally large stake (_balances[account]) participates in the staking pool during a period of high reward rate (rewardPerToken()). Due to the lack of overflow protection in the earned function, the multiplication operation exceeds the maximum integer value, resulting in an integer overflow. As a consequence, the calculated rewards may be inaccurately high, impacting the overall fairness of the reward distribution.
