# Mismatch Between Declared and Actual Total Supply in TruflationToken Contract

## Summary
The `TruflationToken` contract, as per its comments, declares an intended total supply of 100,000,000 TRUF tokens. However, the contract's constructor mints an initial supply of 1,000,000,000 TRUF tokens (1 billion TRUF), which does not match the stated total supply.

## Vulnerability Detail
The discrepancy lies in the difference between the mentioned total supply of 100,000,000 TRUF in the contract comments and the actual minted amount of 1,000,000,000 TRUF within the constructor function.

## Impact
This mismatch between the declared total supply and the actual initial minted amount could potentially confuse users and stakeholders expecting a total supply of 100,000,000 TRUF. It may lead to misunderstandings regarding the tokenomics and distribution plan initially outlined in the contract's comments.

```solidity
contract TruflationToken is ERC677Token {
    constructor() ERC20("Truflation", "TRUF") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1_000_000_000e18); // Mints 1 billion TRUF tokens
    }
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to align the actual initial minted amount with the stated total supply to ensure consistency and transparency in the token's distribution plan. Consider adjusting the initial minted amount to match the stated total supply of 100,000,000 TRUF tokens as mentioned in the contract's comments to avoid confusion and maintain clarity for users and stakeholders.
