# The Claimable function confuses between the cliff period and the initialReleasePeriod.

## Summary
The Claimable function confuses between the cliff period and the initialReleasePeriod.  It treats the cliff period as it it was  initialReleasePeriod and same the other way around. 

## Vulnerability Detail 
The cliff period is the period where no tokens will be released, while during the  initialReleasePeriod, the initialRelease is released. 
Unfortuantely, the implementation of Claimable() gets these two period confused:  It treats the cliff period as it it was  initialReleasePeriod and same the other way around.

## Impact
