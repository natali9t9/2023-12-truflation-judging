# In function `_extendLock`, `newEnd` is calculated incorrectly because it is not calculated based on the current time.

## Summary

In function `_extendLock`, `newEnd` is calculated incorrectly because it is not calculated based on the current time.

## Vulnerability Detail

In function `_extendLock` from `VotingEscrowTruf.sol`, `newEnd` is calculated incorrectly because it is not calculated based on the current time. The comments in function `_extendLock` state that:

```solidity
* The stake end time is computed from the current time + duration, just
* like it is for new stakes. So a new stake for seven days duration and
* an old stake extended with a seven days duration would have the same
* end.
```

Therefore, the correct calculation method is to use the current time plus duration, instead of `oldEnd + duration`.

## Impact

The stake will be ended much earlier, causing contract losses.

## Recommendation

```solidity
uint256 newEnd = block.timestamp + duration;
```
