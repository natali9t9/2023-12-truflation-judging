# Immutable variable cannot be changed after deployment

## Summary
The `constructor` at [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/37ddbb69e0c7fb6510f1ec99162fd9172ec44733/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L141) can set an  invalid value and of  no any important.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `constructor` in `TrufVesting` update the value of  of an `immutable` state variable which is the `tgeTime`, the problem with the constructor is that it checks and ensure that the `tgeTime` is > the timestamp, if not the function will revert:
```solidity
 if (_tgeTime < block.timestamp) {
            revert InvalidTimestamp();
```

the issue is that it never checks to ensure that the `tgeTime` is not equal to the current timestamp, if set to the current timestamp, it  will potential lead to serious issues like users start vesting immediately after the contract's deployment since most of the threshold checks ensure that the `tgeTime` is > or == the current timestamp before allowing vesting, but setting the `tgeTime`   to the current timestamp, user can start vesting immediately.

## Impact

Token can be vested immediately and not in the required or intended time, this will require the re-deployment of the contract to solve the issue since the `tgeTime` is an `immutable` state variable 
```solidity
   /// @dev TGE timestamp
    uint64 public immutable tgeTime;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the `tgeTime` is not equal to the current timestamp also just like the way it ensures that its not less than it , its coded example will be like:

```solidity
constructor(IERC20 _trufToken, uint64 _tgeTime) {
        if (address(_trufToken) == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

        trufToken = _trufToken;

+        if (_tgeTime <= block.timestamp) {
                 revert InvalidTimestamp();
      }

        }
        tgeTime = _tgeTime;
    }
```

`or`
```solidity
require(_tgeTime > block.timestamp, "Invalid timestamp");
```
