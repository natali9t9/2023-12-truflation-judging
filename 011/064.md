# Users who claimed `TRUF` tokens before change of Merkle root might not be able to claim.

## Summary
A user who had claimed tokens before change of the root might not be able to claim again if the increase in reward is less than his previously claimed amount. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The owner can change `merkleRoot` and there are no restrictions. The root can be changed after migration period has started.

```solidity
    function setMerkleRoot(bytes32 _merkleRoot) external onlyOwner {
        merkleRoot = _merkleRoot;

        emit SetMerkleRoot(_merkleRoot);
    }
```

After a user migrates, i.e claims the `TRUF` tokens, the `amount` claimed is stored as the `migratedAmount`. Here, possible root changes are not considered. 
If the root is changed, with a new `amount`, unless the `amount` is much larger than the previous `amount`, users who had migrated in the past will not be able to claim their newly entitled rewards.

```solidity
    function migrate(uint256 index, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof) external {
        bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encode(msg.sender, index, amount));

        if (MerkleProof.verify(proof, merkleRoot, leaf) == false) {
            revert InvalidProof();
        }

        uint256 _migratedAmount = migratedAmount[msg.sender];

        if (amount <= _migratedAmount) { //@note
            revert AlreadyMigrated();
        }

        migratedAmount[msg.sender] = amount;

        uint256 migrateAmount = amount - _migratedAmount;
        trufToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, migrateAmount);

        emit Migrated(msg.sender, migrateAmount);
    }
```
For instance:
- Owner sets merkleroot of 1000 `TRUF` tokens;
- User migrate his entitled 1000 `TRUF` tokens and the user;s `migratedAmount[msg.sender]` is updated to 1000;
- A weed later, the Owner changes the root (for any reason), and sets the new amount to migrate to be 1500;
- The user decides to claim the existing 500;
- The transaction fails because of the check as the amount (to claim) 500 is less than his `_migratedAmount`  1000
```solidity
if (amount <= _migratedAmount) {
            revert AlreadyMigrated();
        }

```
## Impact
Users can not claim their claimable tokens in the case of root change, unless new root `amount` now more than double previous `root`. Depending on the way the protocol goes by with migrations, this might lead to excessive, exponetial release of tokens to accomodate for users who can't claim, which might also lead to devaluing of the tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
A bit of refactoring might be needed, to allow for leftover claims, without having the owners overinflating the token supply.
