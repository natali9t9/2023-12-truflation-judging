# Unreachable exit function

## Summary

Impossible to call the `exit` function in `VirtualStakingRewards` because of the access control.

## Vulnerability Detail

When calling `exit` it first withdraws the user's balance:
```solidity
    function exit(address user) external {
        if (_balances[user] != 0) {
            withdraw(user, _balances[user]);
        }
        getReward(user);
    }
```

However, withdraw has access control so that only the operator can call it:
```solidity
    function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) public updateReward(user) onlyOperator
```

The operator, in this case, is `VotingEscrowTruf` contract and it does not contain a call to `exit`, leaving this function impossible to execute.

## Impact

Users cannot perform an exit in one transaction but can do it separately by first withdrawing and then claiming the rewards. Usually, an exit function exists for an emergency situation, to abandon the rewards and get back the principal but here it updates the rewards anyway.

## Recommendation

Remove the unreachable function or consider refactoring it to allow access.
