# Anyone can exit a virtual staking position for an arbitrary user

## Summary

Anyone can exit a virtual staking position for an arbitrary user using the `exit()` function. Although no real damage in terms of monetary loss can occur on current finances, it can lead to undesired consequences.

## Vulnerability Detail

`VirtualStakingRewards::exit()` function doesn't perform any checks for who the caller is in terms of access control and allows anyone to pass an arbitrary address with the purpose of exiting a position (calls `withdraw()` and `getReward()`). 

```solidity
    function exit(address user) external {
        if (_balances[user] != 0) {
            withdraw(user, _balances[user]);
        }
        getReward(user);
    }
```

## Impact

Although this won't directly benefit the caller of the function in anyway if he passes an arbitrary user address, it may lead to undesired consequences for the user-in question. Example of this would be exiting someone's position just before the reward rate is updated or user thinking that their position is still active and are accruing rewards, while that is not the case anymore.

## Code Snippet

    function exit(address user) external {
        if (_balances[user] != 0) {
            withdraw(user, _balances[user]);
        }
        getReward(user);
    }

## Recommendation
Change the function logic to allow only for msg.sender to update their own position.
