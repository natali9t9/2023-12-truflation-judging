# Increase voting power and bypassing untransferable limits of veTRUF by  tokenizing the address that locks the TRUF token

## Summary
Without restriction on the type of address that lock the token, a bad actor could lock the token through the smart contract. Doing so enable him to make the veTRUF becomes liquidate by tokenize his smart contract which defeat the purpose of the veTRUF that is supposed to be untransferable. Moreover, a bad actor could attract people to lock the token through his smart contract instead of directly locking with VotingEscrowTruf by injecting better short-term incentives to his wrapper token. This enable the bad actor to accumulate voting power that could dictate the future of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Proof of Concept:

1. A bad actor creates a smart contract
2. A contract calls lock in VotingEscrowTruf and locks the token
3. A bad actor tokenizes the contract
4. A bad actor attracts people to lock the token through his smart contract by offering a wrapper tokens or additional incentives like high apy etc.
5. A bad actor dictates the smart contract to delegate its vote to his preferred address.


## Impact
attacker can compromise governance of the protocol and also bypass the untransferable limits.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It would be best to check whether the locker is the smart contract or the wallet and, if the protocol wants the smart contract to be the locker, it can implement the whitelist or blacklist.
