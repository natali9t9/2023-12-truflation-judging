# Lock that is created thorugh TrufVesting can't be increased with amount

## Summary
Lock that is created through TrufVesting can't be increased with amount as such functionality doesn't exist.
## Vulnerability Detail
`TrufVesting.stake` function allows user to stake his tokens(even unvested yet) [to the `VotingEscrowTruf`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L258).

User should provide amount that is [not bigger than what he currently has](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L251-L253).

Once a lock is created for the vesting id, then [second one can't be created](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L245-L247).

User still has ability [to extend existing lock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L270-L279), but he has no ability to increase amount of the lock(or create new lock with additional amount).

This is the problem as it's possible that user would like to provide additional amount of tokens to increase his voting power, but he will not be able to use vesting tokens from same vesting info.
## Impact
User can't increase amount of his stake.

## Recommendation
Just create additional function that allows user to increase amount in existing lock.
