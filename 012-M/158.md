# User is not able to stake vesting more than once causing them to lose potential rewards

## Summary
The TrufVesting::stake() function enables users to stake their vested amount, predetermined by the Admin. The vesting period spans 1, 2, or 4 years, which is notably lengthy. As a consequence, claiming all tokens takes a considerable amount of time, resulting in users having the option to claim only a small amount within a short period, leading to limited voting power. The initial intention was to empower users with higher voting authority by allowing them to lock their entire vesting; however, the current implementation hinders users from doing so.
## Vulnerability Detail
The limitation of being able to call TrufVesting::stake() only once not only prevents users from staking and earning more rewards but also reduces their voting power. Additionally, if an admin seeks to increase the user's vesting using TrufVesting::setUserVesting() in the future, the user is unable to leverage the vested amount to stake and gain additional voting power.
## Impact
This restriction prevents users from staking their vested amounts, resulting in the inability to claim more rewards and a consequent reduction in their overall voting power.

To run `forge test --match-test testStakeTwice_Revert -vv`
```solidity
//TrufVesting.t.sol
    function testStakeTwice_Revert() external {
        console.log("PoC restake to veTRUF reverts");

        _setupVestingPlan();
        _setupExampleUserVestings();

        uint256 categoryId = 0;
        uint256 vestingId = 0;
        uint256 stakeAmount = 10e18;
        uint256 duration = 30 days;

        (uint256 amount,,, uint64 startTime) = vesting.userVestings(categoryId, vestingId, alice);

        uint256 trufBalanceBefore = trufToken.balanceOf(address(vesting));

        vm.startPrank(alice);

        vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true, address(vesting));
        emit Staked(categoryId, vestingId, alice, stakeAmount, duration, 1);
        
        vesting.stake(categoryId, vestingId, stakeAmount, duration);

        assertEq(trufToken.balanceOf(address(veTRUF)), stakeAmount, "Staked amount is invalid");
        assertEq(trufToken.balanceOf(address(vesting)), trufBalanceBefore - stakeAmount, "Remaining balance is invalid");

        (uint128 lockupAmount,,,, bool lockupIsVesting) = veTRUF.lockups(alice, 0);

        assertEq(lockupAmount, stakeAmount, "Lockup amount is invalid");
        assertEq(lockupIsVesting, true, "Lockup vesting flag is invalid");

        _validateUserVesting(categoryId, vestingId, alice, amount, 0, stakeAmount, startTime);
        assertEq(vesting.lockupIds(categoryId, vestingId, alice), 1, "Lockup id is invalid");

        //Stake Again which reverts
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSignature("LockExist()"));
        vesting.stake(categoryId, vestingId, stakeAmount, duration);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to modify the implementation to allow users to stake multiple times for their vested amounts.
