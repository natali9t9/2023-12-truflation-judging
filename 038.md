# Vulnerability in Migration Logic Causing Constraint on Equal Token Migrations

## Summary
The code features a migration function for transferring tokens based on a Merkle tree snapshot. However, it contains a logic flaw in the comparison of migration amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the comparison logic within the migration function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufMigrator.sol#L55-L64

```solidity
uint256 _migratedAmount = migratedAmount[msg.sender];
if (amount <= _migratedAmount) {
    revert AlreadyMigrated();
}
```
The code checks if the requested migration amount is less than or equal to the previously migrated amount. However, in scenarios where the requested amount matches the previously migrated amount, the code raises an error, prohibiting further migration.
## Impact
This logic flaw restricts users from migrating an equal amount of tokens that have already been migrated. Users are unable to perform multiple migrations for an amount equal to the previously migrated tokens, limiting their flexibility in managing token migrations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the comparison operator to < instead of <= in the migration function:
```solidity
uint256 _migratedAmount = migratedAmount[msg.sender];
if (amount < _migratedAmount) {
    revert AlreadyMigrated();
}

```
