# User can claim the `initialReleasePct` multiple times until the `cliff` is not passed

## Summary
User is able to claim `initialReleasePct` multiple times when the `initialReleasePeriod` is passed but `cliff` period is not passed.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say:
```solidity
  initialReleasePct = 10 // 10% will be claimable after `initialReleasePeriod` is passed
  initialReleasePeriod = 6 months // after 6 months, user claims 10% 
  cliff = 3 months // after the initialPercent (10%) is claimed, then user can't claim anything in these 3 months
  period = 1 year // after 9 months (6 months+ 3 months), then the vesting of 1 year starts
  unit = 1 month // after 9 months, 1 year vesting starts, then a part of that remaining 90% will be claimable per month (7.5% each month)
```
So we assume the `initialReleasePeriod` is passed (6 months passed) and User calls `claim` to claim the `initialReleasePct` which is 10% of the vesting amount:
```solidity
function claim(address user, uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, uint256 claimAmount) public {
        if (user != msg.sender && (!categories[categoryId].adminClaimable || msg.sender != owner())) {
            revert Forbidden(msg.sender);
        }

        uint256 claimableAmount = claimable(categoryId, vestingId, user); // @audit claimable returns 10% of the totalAmount while the cliff period is not passed
        
        if (claimAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            claimAmount = claimableAmount;
        } else if (claimAmount > claimableAmount) {
            revert ClaimAmountExceed();
        }

        if (claimAmount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmount();
        }

        categories[categoryId].totalClaimed += claimAmount;
        userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user].claimed += claimAmount;
        trufToken.safeTransfer(user, claimAmount);

        emit Claimed(categoryId, vestingId, user, claimAmount);
    }
```
The above function first authorizes the sender and then goes to `claimable` to calculate how much of tokens are claimable at time of calling:
```solidity
function claimable(uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, address user)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256 claimableAmount)
    {
        UserVesting memory userVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user];

        VestingInfo memory info = vestingInfos[categoryId][vestingId];

        uint64 startTime = userVesting.startTime + info.initialReleasePeriod;

        if (startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 totalAmount = userVesting.amount;

        uint256 initialRelease = (totalAmount * info.initialReleasePct) / DENOMINATOR;

        startTime += info.cliff;

        if (startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return initialRelease;
        }
```
First it checks if the `initialReleasePeriod` is not passed, then returns `0` which means no amount is claimable until the `initialReleasePeriod` is not passed.
But now we have assumed the 6 months is passed so this check will be passed and it continues, Then it checks if the `cliff` period is not passed it always returns `initialRelease` which is 10% of the total amount (the problem is here, it should first check if the initialPercent is already claimed or not).
It means if the user calls again the `claim` function, he will be success to claim another 10% of the total amount, because the `userVesting#claimed` doesn't effect on anything while the `cliff` period is not passed.
## Impact
User claims more than expected after the initial period is passed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider tracking if the initial percent is claimed or not, when the initial period is passed and the user claims the initial percent, then the user shouldn't be able to claim again the initial percent.
