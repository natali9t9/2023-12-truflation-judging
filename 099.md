# Modifiers should not make state changes
## Summary
The problem is in the modifier `updateReward`, it makes state changes wich violates the check-effects-pattern. Making state changes in `updateRewad` could result in unexpected behavior to the functions its attached to. The order of execution matters in solidity. When a modifier performs checks after making state changes, it could lead to inconsistencies between the state of the contract and the expected behavior.

For more information about this bug see secureum 101 `7.Modifier side-effects`.
## Impact
All of the functions `updateReward` is attached to could be unusable.
## Code Snippet
    modifier updateReward(address account) {
        rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
        lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable();
        if (account != address(0)) {
            rewards[account] = earned(account);
            userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
        _;
    }
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The reccomended solidity practice is to first perform checks then make chages.
