# Initial release amount in `claimable` function has no checks, and can be claimed as many times as the exploiter wishes

## Summary

`claimable` in `TrufVesting.sol` does no real checking before releasing the initial release amount, which leads to many issues. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the code for `claimable` in `TrufVesting.sol`:

```solidity
UserVesting memory userVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user];

VestingInfo memory info = vestingInfos[categoryId][vestingId];

uint64 startTime = userVesting.startTime + info.initialReleasePeriod;

if (startTime > block.timestamp) {
return 0;
}

uint256 totalAmount = userVesting.amount;

uint256 initialRelease = (totalAmount * info.initialReleasePct) / DENOMINATOR;

startTime += info.cliff;

if (startTime > block.timestamp) {
// @audit: This seems buggy, as it does not take locked amount into account
return initialRelease;
}
```

We can see that the code just checks that the time to release the initial release is correct (so after vesting start time but before the cliff), and if so returns `initialRelease`. Then, in the `claim` function, this initial release amount is sent back to the user. There is nothing stopping the user therefore from claiming this initial release amount as many times as they want, allowing them to drain all `TRUF` funds from the contract. 

Another issue is that the returned `initialRelease` amount is not checked against the locked amount, so even if you've locked up all your funds in veTRUF, you will still be able to claim `initialRelease`

## Impact

Drain all TRUF from the `TrufVesting` contract

## Recommendation
Don't allow claiming initial release amount multiple times and checked locked amount against the initial release amount.
