# Users retain their voting power after the lock expiration

## Summary


## Vulnerability Detail
The purpose of the VotingEscrowTurf is to give users voting power propotionally to the staked amount and the length of their locking duration. However, once lockPeriod ends, users can still use their veTRUF for voting until they decide to get their TRUF back.

Users who locked once for 3 years will never have to stake these tokens again - until withdrawn, they will **permanently** have the max voting power per staked token.
### Foundry PoC
Add to VotingEscrowTruf.t.sol:
```solidity
    function testStake_PoC() external {
        uint256 amount = 100e18;
        uint256 duration = 30 days;

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        veTRUF.stake(amount, duration, alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        skip(1 days);
        vm.roll(block.number + 86400 / 2);

        uint256 initialVotingPower = veTRUF.getPastVotes(alice, block.number - 1);
        assertGt(initialVotingPower, 0);

        // changing the timestamp
        skip(365 days);
        // changing the block number (2 sec/block on base)
        vm.roll(block.number + 15768000);

        // alice is able to vote 1 year later despite locking only for 30 days
        assertEq(initialVotingPower, veTRUF.getPastVotes(alice, block.number - 1));
    }
```
## Impact
Users are allowed to vote with veTRUF which lock has expired.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Expired locks must become worthless:
1. Allow only one stake per account.
2. Override `getPastVotes` so it will return 0 if the lock has expired.
