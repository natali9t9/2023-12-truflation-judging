# Design of veTokens disincentivizes new users or relocking as unlocked positions continue to have their voting power and points

## Summary
Unlocked veTokens still have voting power, points and considered staked balances which receive rewards disincentivizes relocking or new users to lock.

## Vulnerability Detail

Bad actors with unlocked positions can potentially vote, unstake and dump their positions immediately.

## Impact
Users may avoid locking or relock their positions as there is little to no incentive to do so.

## Code Snippet
An example to show Alice has her voting power after the lock has ended

```solidity
    function testPOC() external {

        uint256 amount = 100e18;
        uint256 duration = 10 days;
        
        uint256 aliceStartingBalance = (trufToken.balanceOf(alice));        
        
        
        _stake(amount, duration, alice, alice);

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        veTRUF.delegate(alice);
        
        assertEq(veTRUF.balanceOf(alice), veTRUF.getVotes(alice));
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 20 days);

        // alice still has same number of votes she started with
        assertEq(veTRUF.balanceOf(alice), veTRUF.getVotes(alice));

        // get ve details
        (uint128 lockedAmount, uint128 veDuration, uint128 veEnds, uint256 vePoints, bool veIsVesting) =
            veTRUF.lockups(alice, 0);

        assertEq(vePoints, veTRUF.balanceOf(alice));

        // alice can immediately unstake after voting
        veTRUF.unstake(0);

        uint256 aliceEndingBalance = (trufToken.balanceOf(alice));
        // check balance after unstake same as starting balance
        assertEq(aliceStartingBalance, aliceEndingBalance);

    }        
```
## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

Consider unstaking positions that have finished their lock or allow the ve positions to decay linearly.
