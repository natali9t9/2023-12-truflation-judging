# function `_contractFallback()` doesn't check the return value of the `onTokenTransfer()` hook

## Summary
contract ERC677Token is and ERC677 token but the implementation doesn't follow the EIP correctly. in EIP it's mentioned that the code should call `onTokenTransfer()` and check the return value to be `True`, the current implementation doesn't check the return value of the `onTokenTransfer()` function. so ERC677Token would allow sending tokens to some contracts that doesn't supposed to receive ERC677 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `transferAndCall()` code:
```javascript
    function transferAndCall(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) public returns (bool success) {
        super.transfer(_to, _value);
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value, _data);
        if (Address.isContract(_to)) {
            _contractFallback(_to, _value, _data);
        }
        return true;
    }

    // PRIVATE
    function _contractFallback(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) private {
        IERC677Receiver receiver = IERC677Receiver(_to);
        receiver.onTokenTransfer(msg.sender, _value, _data);
    }
```
as you can see code doesn't check the return value of the `receiver.onTokenTransfer()` to make sure it's `true`. so in these cases:
1. contract have `onTokenTransfer()` function but it returns `false` as a way of rejecting the transfer.
2. contract doesn't have `onTokenTransfer()` function but have `fallback()` function.

contract ERC677Token would allow token transfer while according to the EIP the transfer shouldn't happen.

## Impact
ERC677Token is not comply fully with EIP and some contract that shouldn't receive the token would receive it and tokens would be lost

## Recommendation
check the return value of the `onTokenTransfer()` and make sure it's `true`
