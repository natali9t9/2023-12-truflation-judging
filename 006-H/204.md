# _delegate missing when migrating user

## Summary

`_delegate` should be called for the new user when migrating in VotingEscrowTruf

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_stake`, we find the following code:

```solidity
        if (delegates(to) == address(0)) {
            // Delegate voting power to the receiver, if unregistered
            _delegate(to, to);
        }
```

However, in migrateVestingLock, which will migrate a user to a new user, we do not delegate again for the new user, which leads to potential loss of voting power. 

## Impact
