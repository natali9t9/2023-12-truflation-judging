# Users can immediately stake their full vesting amounts

## Summary

Users can immediately stake their full vesting amounts, irrespective of their vesting schedule.


## Vulnerability Detail

As soon as [`setUserVesting()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L484) is called, and there are funds in the vesting contract (as is in the deployment [script](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/script/01_deployTrufAndVesting.sol#L36-L37)), the user is able to call [`stake()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L241) and stake their full amount, irrespective of the [TGE timestamp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L125), their [start time](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L513), their vesting [cliff](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L178), or any of the other factors that limit user actions.


## Impact

Staked tokens get rewards not based on how many tokens are staked, but on what fraction of the total staked tokens they've staked is. If they're the only one to figure this out and are the only one staking, they'll get all of the rewards until someone else finally stakes, even though they should have been prevented from staking anything in the first place.


## Code Snippet

The `stake()` function doesn't check anything from the emission schedule or from the user's start time:
```solidity
// File: src/token/TrufVesting.sol : TrufVesting.stake()   #1

241        function stake(uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, uint256 amount, uint256 duration) external {
242            if (amount == 0) {
243                revert ZeroAmount();
244            }
245            if (lockupIds[categoryId][vestingId][msg.sender] != 0) {
246                revert LockExist();
247            }
248    
249            UserVesting storage userVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][msg.sender];
250    
251            if (amount > userVesting.amount - userVesting.claimed - userVesting.locked) {
252                revert InvalidAmount();
253            }
254    
255            userVesting.locked += amount;
256    
257            trufToken.safeIncreaseAllowance(address(veTRUF), amount);
258            uint256 lockupId = veTRUF.stakeVesting(amount, duration, msg.sender) + 1;
259            lockupIds[categoryId][vestingId][msg.sender] = lockupId;
260    
261            emit Staked(categoryId, vestingId, msg.sender, amount, duration, lockupId);
262:       }
```

## Recommendation

Disallow staking via the `TrufVesting` contract, until after the user's cliff has been passed.
