# Expired lockers can dilute the staking rewards

## Summary
When a lock expires, the user should re-lock to continue accruing rewards. However, there is no way to compel someone to unstake their expired locks. This implies that once a lock has ended, the lock owner has no incentive to re-lock their position and can maintain the same points in the staking contract to continue accruing rewards
## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, when a lock reaches its end threshold, there is no way for someone else to remove the lock owner from the system. The only option to remove the user is for the user themselves to call `unstake`. This is because almost all functions utilize 'msg.sender,' and it's not possible for someone else to update the staking information for a lock owner.

Let's assume I have staked 400e18 tokens for 3 years, which means I have accrued 400 points. When the 3-year period elapses and my lock ends, I still retain my 400 points. I have no incentive whatsoever to unstake and relock my stake. I can hold onto my 400 points for as long as I want and continue earning staking rewards from the virtual staking rewards contract until I decide to unstake.
## Impact
High, because anyone can abuse the system by sitting at their ended locks and earn rewards still.

## Recommendation
Add a kick function, simply a function that checks a given users lock and if the lock is ended then unstakes the lock for that user. That function should be callable by anyone since it will only kick the user if only the lock is ended.
