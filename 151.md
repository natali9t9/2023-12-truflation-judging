# in rewardRate calculation, division is before multiplication and will cause rounding error for rewardRate and wrong reward distribution

## Summary
In contract VirtualStakingRewards, to distribute the rewards over time, code calculates `rewardRate` and `rewardPerTokenStored` and there is division in both calculations (`/ rewardsDuration`, `/ totalSupply`). to avoid rounding errors and precisions loss and to have fair and correct reward distribution code use `1e18` in `rewardPerTokenStored` calculation. but this won't prevent division `/ rewardsDuration` rounding error and that division happens before multiplying. this can be avoided by using `1e18` in `rewardRate` calculation instead of the `rewardPerTokenStored`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In contract VirtualStakingRewards, to distribute the rewards over time, code calculates `rewardRate` and `rewardPerTokenStored` like this:
```javascript
rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration
rewardPerTokenStored = (currentTime - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / totalSupply
```
As you can see code performs division (`/ rewardsDuration`) and them in the next line multiply (` * 1e18`).
when calculating `rewardPerTokenStored` code uses `1e18` in nominator to avoid precision loss, but precision loss for `rewardRate` is not avoided. `1e18` should be used in calculating `rewardRate` like this:
```javascript
rewardRate = (1e18 * reward) / rewardsDuration
rewardPerTokenStored = (currentTime - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate) / totalSupply
```
this way both division's rounding errors can be avoided. 

## Impact
in current implementation, reward rate would be lower than real amount and users won't receive correct reward amount. the left over rewards would be distributed in the future so current users would lose some rewards and future users would receive it.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
make calculation likes this:
```javascript
rewardRate = (1e18 * reward) / rewardsDuration
rewardPerTokenStored = (currentTime - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate) / totalSupply
```
