# Lack of Explicit Check for Sufficient Balance in TrufMigrator.sol


## Summary

The `withdrawTruf()` function in the `TrufMigrator.sol` lacks an explicit check to ensure that the contract has a sufficient token balance before attempting to transfer tokens to `msg.sender`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Token balance check is missing before token transfer call

```solidity

     function withdrawTruf(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        ---HERE---
        trufToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

## Impact

While the Ethereum network will automatically revert a transaction if the sender does not have a sufficient token balance, explicitly checking the balance before initiating the transfer provides an additional layer of validation and can help prevent unnecessary gas costs associated with failed transactions.

## Code Snippet

```solidity

    function withdrawTruf(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
         ---HERE---
        trufToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```solidity
  require(
     trufToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount,
     "Not Enough Tokens"
);
```
