# During `cancelVesting()` the user may receive fewer tokens than anticipated

## Summary

In the `cancelVesting()` function, the protocol transfers the `claimableAmount` tokens to the user and subsequently deletes the user's vesting record. However, the calculation of `claimableAmount` still depends on the current emission limit of the category. If, at the time the owner calls `cancelVesting()`, the situation arises where `claimableAmount > emissionLeft`, the user will receive fewer tokens than anticipated.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `cancelVesting()` function, the protocol calls `claimable()` to retrieve the `claimableAmount`. This value is also related to the current emission limit of the category. If, during the cancellation of vesting, the situation arises where `claimableAmount > emissionLeft`, the protocol will prioritize the smaller value.
```solidity
       claimableAmount = vestedAmount - userVesting.claimed;
        uint256 emissionLeft = getEmission(categoryId) - categories[categoryId].totalClaimed;

        if (claimableAmount > emissionLeft) {
            claimableAmount = emissionLeft;
        }

```

 However, the actual `claimableAmount` may be greater than `emissionLeft`. Later in the `cancelVesting()` function, the protocol removes the record of user vesting, resulting in the user receiving fewer `trufToken` tokens than anticipated.

## Impact
The user will receive fewer tokens than anticipated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a validation that `cancelVesting()` can only be executed when `claimableAmount <= emissionLeft`.
