# Improper reward balance checks in `VirtualStakingRewards.sol::notifyRewardAmount()` can result in inability for a user to claim rewards

## Summary

An improper balance check could lead to insufficient rewards in the contract and respectively a user being unable to claim their rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `notifyRewardAmount` is used to calculate the `rewardRate` and update time-related reward variables. However, the method only checks if the reward tokens balance is enough to distribute the newly added rewards for their duration

```solidity
        uint256 balance = IERC20(rewardsToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (rewardRate > balance / rewardsDuration) {
            revert InsufficientRewards();
        }
```

The problem is that part of this balance could be for yet unclaimed rewards from users, which means the current check is not sufficient to prove there are enough rewards for the new rewards duration. This means that if the admin calls `notifyRewardAmount` with a bigger reward amount than it has loaded in, it is possible that there wonâ€™t be enough rewards for all users to claim, because the calculations were made based on a balance that is partly from already accrued but unclaimed rewards.

For example:

Given:

- rewardsDuration = 7 days;

1. Alice stakes 1,000 `stakingToken`;
2. `rewardsDistribution` sends 100 `rewardsToken` to the contract;
3. `rewardsDistribution` calls `notifyRewardAmount` with `amount = 100`;
4. 7 days later, Alice calls `earned()` and it returns `100 rewardsToken`, but Alice chooses not to `getReward()` for now;
5. `rewardsDistribution` calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with `amount = 100` without sending any fund to the contract, the tx will success;
6. 7 days later, Alice calls `earned()` `200` rewardsToken, when Alice tries to call `getReward()`, the transaction fails due to insufficient balance of rewardsToken.

The transaction in step 5 should revert.

## Impact

This vulnerability can result in an inability of a staker to claim his rewards because there is not enough reward token balance in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A possible solution is to transfer the `reward` amount of tokens that the `notifyRewardAmount` takes as an input parameter within the function to make sure that the rewards balance is always sufficient:

```diff
+rewardsToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), reward);
```
