# "VirtualStakingRewards.sol#notifyRewardAmount()" Does not check the balance properly and some users may be unable to get their rewards

## Summary

In `VirtualStakingRewards.sol#notifyRewardAmount()`, the function checks wether the contract has enough balance to distribute rewards. 
```solidity

uint256 balance = IERC20(rewardsToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (rewardRate > balance / rewardsDuration) {
            revert InsufficientRewards();
        }

```



However the balance of the contract may have unclaimed rewards that belong to other users, putting it in a state where not all users will be able to withdraw their rewards.

## Vulnerability Details

The following scenerio may reveal how the contract could become in a state where it will be unable to repay rewards:
1. Alice stakes 1000 staking tokens 
2. RewardsDistribution sends 100 reward tokens to the contract 
3. Rewards distribution calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with rewards = 100 reward tokens
4. 7 days later, Alice calls `earned()` and it returns 100 reward tokens, but Alice doesn't withdraw them
5. rewardsDistribution calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with reward = 100 without sending any fund to contract
6. 7 days later, Alice calls `earned()` 200 rewardsToken, when Alice tries to call `getReward()`, the transaction will fail due to insufficient balance of rewardsToken.

The transaction in step 5 will pass.

PoC:

```solidity

function testExploit() external {
        uint256 rewards = 100e18;

        uint256 amount = 1000e18;
        // Alice stakes 1_000 Tokens
        vm.prank(operator);
        trufStakingRewards.stake(alice, amount);
        //rewards Distribution calls notifyRewardAmount() with rewards = 100*1e18
        vm.startPrank(rewardsDistribuion);
        trufToken.transfer(address(trufStakingRewards), rewards);
        trufStakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount(100e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // 7 days later, Alice calls earned() and it returns 100 rewardToken, but Alice chooses not to call getReward() for now
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        console.log(trufStakingRewards.earned(alice));
        // rewardsDistribution calls notifyRewardAmount() with amount = 100 without sending any funds to the contract, the tx will not revert
        vm.prank(rewardsDistribuion);
        trufStakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount(100e18); // Doenst revert!!!
        //alice stakes again
        vm.prank(operator);
        trufStakingRewards.stake(alice, amount);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 14 days);
        // Alice calls earned expecting to receive 200 tokens, but the transaction will fail due to InsufficientRewards
        console.log(trufStakingRewards.earned(alice));
        trufStakingRewards.getReward(alice);
    }
```
And terminal outputs:

## Impact

The contract will become in a state in which it won't have enough rewards for the users to withdraw thus I will label this as medium.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider changing the function notifyRewardAmount to addReward and use transferFrom to transfer rewardsToken into the contract.
