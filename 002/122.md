# Precision Loss in `notifyRewardAmount` Function

## Summary
The `notifyRewardAmount` function in the `VirtualStakingRewards` contract exhibits a potential precision loss issue due to the order of operations in the calculation of the `rewardRate`. The current implementation performs division before multiplication, which can result in a loss of precision when dealing with decimal values.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `rewardRate` within the `notifyRewardAmount` function. The code calculates the reward rate as `(reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration`, where `leftover` is calculated as `remaining * rewardRate`. The problem arises from dividing before multiplying, which may lead to precision loss, especially when dealing with non-integer values. This precision loss could affect the accuracy of reward distribution over time.

```solidity
// Vulnerable code snippet
rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
```
## Impact
The precision loss in the calculation of `rewardRate` can result in inaccuracies in the distribution of rewards. Over time, this may lead to discrepancies in the actual rewards received by users, potentially affecting the integrity of the staking reward system.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rearrange the order of operations in the calculation. The multiplication `(reward + leftover)` should be performed before the division `(/ rewardsDuration)`.
