# VestingInfo.period causes the logic of the two functions to be inconsistent

## Summary

There are two member variables in the [[VestingInfo](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L94-L100)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L94-L100) structure: `cliff` and `period`. The former represents Cliff period and the latter represents Total period. The [[claimable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L159-L162)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L159-L162) function is used to calculate the claimable amount from `userVesting.startTime` to `block.timestamp`, [[which does not include cliff period](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L178-L186)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L178-L186). The [[cancelVesting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L348)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L348) function will check whether `block.timestamp` has exceeded `userVesting.startTime + VestingInfo.period` before canceling vesting, [[which include cliff period](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L358-L360)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L358-L360).

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue described in this report is that `VestingInfo` has a Cliff period. Let us analyze the code of these two functions in detail to prove this problem.

```state
Assuming that the starting state is as follows:
tgeTime = t
VestingInfo(
    initialReleasePct:    500,		//5% 
    initialReleasePeriod: 30 days, 
    cliff:  6 * 30 days, 
    period: 24 * 30 days, 
    unit:   30 days
)
alice’s UserVesting is (
    amount:  1000e18, 
    claimed: 0, 
    locked:  0, 
    startTime: t
)
```

The code for [[claimable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L159-L202)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L159-L202) is as follows:

```solidity
File: truflation-contracts\src\token\TrufVesting.sol
159:     function claimable(uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, address user)
160:         public
161:         view
162:         returns (uint256 claimableAmount)
163:     {
......
168:->       uint64 startTime = userVesting.startTime + info.initialReleasePeriod;
......
174: 	     uint256 totalAmount = userVesting.amount;
176:	     uint256 initialRelease = (totalAmount * info.initialReleasePct) / DENOMINATOR;
178:->       startTime += info.cliff;
.....
184:->       uint64 timeElapsed = ((uint64(block.timestamp) - startTime) / info.unit) * info.unit;
185: 
186:->       uint256 vestedAmount = ((totalAmount - initialRelease) * timeElapsed) / info.period + initialRelease;
......
202:     }
```

L168, startTime = t + 30 days

L176, initialRelease = 1000e18 * 500 / 10000 = 50e18

L178, startTime = t + 30 days + 180 days = t + 210 days

Assuming `block.timestamp` is equal to `t + 240 days`,

L184, timeElapsed = (240 - 210) / 30 * 30 = 30

L186, vestedAmount = (1000e18 - 50e18) * 30 / (24 * 30) + 50e18 = 950e18 / 24 + 50e18 = 89.58333e18

In fact, this is equivalent to receiving 1/24 of 950e18 per month after 7 months (`initialReleasePeriod+cliff`). That means it will spend another 24 months to claim all 950e18. All time is not period (24 months), but 24+7 months.

However, judging whether userVesting has been vested in `cancelVesting` is as follows:

```solidity
File: truflation-contracts\src\token\TrufVesting.sol
348:     function cancelVesting(uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, address user, bool giveUnclaimed)
349:         external
350:         onlyOwner
351:     {
......
358:->       if (userVesting.startTime + vestingInfos[categoryId][vestingId].period <= block.timestamp) {
359:             revert AlreadyVested(categoryId, vestingId, user);
360:         }
......
388:     }
```

L358, if `block.timestamp` is greater than `startTime + vestingInfo.period` (t + 24 * 30days), then the vesting cannot be canceled. However, in the above analysis, after 24 months, it will take another 7 months to claim the remaining amount(950e18 * 7 / 24). 

This means that if Alice's UserVesting should be canceled after 24 months, owner cannot cancel it due to this check. Alice can still claim the remaining tokens.

## Impact

This issue should be considered in two situations:

1. The logic of `claimable` is correct. That is to say, it will take Alice 24+7 months to claim 1000e18 token. The impact is: if after 24 months, Alice's vesting needs to be canceled due to some reasons, the remaining 7 months of unclaimed tokens cannot be canceled, and Alice can still claim them. This is a loss of funds for the protocol.

2. If `VestingInfo.period` represents the entire vesting time, that is to say, it will take 24 months to receive 1000e18. Then, the logic of `claimable` is incorrect, which obviously extends the user's time. The price of tokens changes every day, which is a risk for users.

## Recommendation

For situation 1, checking whether vesting has been vested in `cancelVesting` should be `period + initialReleasePeriod +cliff`.

For situation 2, `info.period` in [[claimable's L186](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L186)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L186) should be replaced by `(info.period - info.initialReleasePeriod - info.cliff)`.
