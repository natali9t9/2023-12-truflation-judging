# There is no way to withdraw token rewards after `rewardsDistribution` is over

## Summary

There is a possibility that when `rewardsDistribution` is over there is some residue token rewards left in the `VirtualStakingRewards.sol` contract

## Vulnerability Detail

Wrong reward amount calculation

```solidity

   function notifyRewardAmount(
        uint256 reward
    ) external onlyRewardsDistribution updateReward(address(0)) {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
        }

       ....
    }

```

if `onlyRewardsDistribution` will call `notifyRewardAmount(reward)` before `rewardsDuration` is over, then it can rolls over any remaining rewards into the new period to distribute. But If `onlyRewardsDistribution` will call `notifyRewardAmount(reward)` after `rewardsDuration` is over then its just starting a new period with new rewards and there is no way to retrieve/withdraw rewards sitting in contract `VirtualStakingRewards.sol`

## Impact

Losing leftover token rewards because `onlyRewardsDistribution` will call `notifyRewardAmount(reward)` after `rewardsDuration` is over , then its just starting a new period with new rewards and there is no way to retrieve/withdraw rewards sitting in contract `VirtualStakingRewards.sol`

## Code Snippet

```solidity

   function notifyRewardAmount(
        uint256 reward
    ) external onlyRewardsDistribution updateReward(address(0)) {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
        }

       ....
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add below function in `VirtualStakingRewards.sol`

`totalRewardAmount` update it every time reward[account] is updating like this

```solidity

    modifier updateReward(address account) {
        ..
        if (account != address(0)) {
            totalRewardAmount -= rewards[account];
            rewards[account] = earned(account);
            totalRewardAmount += rewards[account];
           ..
        }
        _;
    }

     function getReward(
        address user
    ) public updateReward(user) returns (uint256 reward) {
        reward = rewards[user];
        if (reward != 0) {
            totalRewardAmount -= rewards[user];
            ...
        }
    }
```

```solidity

       function WithdrawReward() public onlyOwner {
        require((block.timestamp >= periodFinish), "RewardsDuration not over");
        require(totalRewardAmount <= 0, "unclaimed rewards in contract"); // to ensure all rewards are claimed
        require(_totalSupply <= 0, "unstaked amount left");  // no stake amount left
        uint256 balance = IERC20(rewardsToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(rewardsToken).transfer(msg.sender, balance);
    }

```
