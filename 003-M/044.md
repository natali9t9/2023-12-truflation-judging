# VirtualStakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount() does not calculate the remaing reward correctly, leading to some rewards lost in the contract forever.

## Summary]
VirtualStakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount() does not calculate the remaing reward correctly, leading to some rewards lost in the contract forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
VirtualStakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount() does not calculate the remaing reward correctly.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol#L144-L151](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol#L144-L151)

This is because when ``_totalSupply == 0``, no rewards will be distributed -  rewardPerTokenStored will not change while lastUpdateTime will be advanced. 

```javascript

    function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
        return
            rewardPerTokenStored + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / _totalSupply);
    }

    modifier updateReward(address account) {
        rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
        lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable();
        if (account != address(0)) {
            rewards[account] = earned(account);
            userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
        _;
    }
```

As a result, when ``notifyRewardAmount()`` is called, the remaing rewards only culates the remaining time without accouting the time during which ``_sppply = 0``. Therefore, the remaining amount is less than it is supposed to be. Some rewards will be lost to the contract forever. 

## Impact
VirtualStakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount() does not calculate the remaing reward correctly, leading to some rewards lost in the contract forever.

## Recommendation
Keep track of the the actual remaininng reward by introducing another remaingReweard state variable.
