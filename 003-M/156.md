# Some rewards tokens might get stuck in `VirtualStakingRewards.sol` when `_totalSupply == 0`

## Summary

When `_totalSupply` in `VirtualStakingRewards.sol` is 0 (ie. there are no stakers) and `block.timestamp <= periodFinish` (ie. a reward period is currently active) some rewards are not distributed and are stuck in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `VirtualStakingRewards.sol` contract is used to distribute rewards and does so by keeping track of the amount of rewards to distribute per second via the `rewardRate` variable. The variable is set in the `notifyRewardAmount()` function and is calculated as:
```solidity
rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration
```
The assumption is that rewards will be distributed each second for the whole `rewardsDuration` period.

However, there might be periods when `_totalSupply == 0` during which rewards are not distributed, because there are no stakers, as coded at [#L89](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol#L89):
```solidity
    function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored; //<-- AWLAYS RETURNS `rewardPerTokenStored` ITSELF WHEN _totalSupply == 0
        }
        return
            rewardPerTokenStored + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / _totalSupply);
    }
```

## Impact
Some rewards tokens will be stuck in the contract because `rewardRate` assumes rewards will be distributed for each second of the duration, but this is not true when there are no stakers. This can be the case if:
- `notifyRewardAmount()` is called when there are no stakers, as it happens in the test suite of the project
- All addresses unstake during a reward period

## POC
Copy paste this test function in `VotingEscrowTruf.t.sol` to test the described bug:

```solidity
    function testClaimRewardTotalSupply0() external {
        console.log("POC: Claim reward is calculated wrongly if there's periods where totalSupply == 0");

        uint256 amount = 100e18;
        uint256 duration = 30 days;

        console.log("1. notifyRewardAmount() is called during setup with 200e18 rewards to distribute.");
        console.log("2. 5 days pass by. This creates a gap of 5 days during which totalSupply == 0.");
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 days);

        console.log("3. Bob stakes 100e18 for 30 days and is the only staker in the system.");
        _stake(amount, duration, alice, bob);

        console.log("4. 30 days pass by.");
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        
        console.log("4. Bob should be able to claim all of the 200e18 rewards because he is the only staker in the system.");
        uint256 bobBalanceBefore = trufToken.balanceOf(bob);
        veTRUF.claimReward();
        uint256 bobBalanceAfter = trufToken.balanceOf(bob);

        console.log("5. Bob is only able to claim %s instead.", bobBalanceAfter - bobBalanceBefore);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recalculate `rewardRate` if for some time `_totalSupply == 0` in such a way that all rewards are correctly distributed.
