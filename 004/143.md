# `TrufVesting` migration forget to move rewards from `VirtualStakingRewards` along to new address if user really lost their private keys


## Summary

[`TrufVesting.migrateUser()` is used when user lost his private key](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L303).
However, this only move voting tokens not rewards earned during this time.
The rewards accrued during this time will still be on lost private key address. While new migration address will restart earning rewards from 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

`TrufVesting.sol` migrate user by calling into `VotingEscrowTruf.sol` to move voting tokens from old address to new address.
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L328-L334>

```solidity
        if (lockupId != 0) {//@audit-ok  Migrate user only work for same category .M owner have absolute power over user vesting. Even those limit by adminclaimable. It suppose to be allow only liquidity owned by protocol.
            newLockupId = veTRUF.migrateVestingLock(prevUser, newUser, lockupId - 1) + 1;//@migration chain here
            lockupIds[categoryId][vestingId][newUser] = newLockupId;
            delete lockupIds[categoryId][vestingId][prevUser];

            newVesting.locked = prevVesting.locked;
        }
```

`VotingEscrowTruf.sol` did migrate voting tokens from old address to new address. And calling `VirtualStakingRewards` to withdraw old balance and staking into new address.

```solidity
        uint256 points = oldLockup.points;
        stakingRewards.withdraw(oldUser, points);//@audit-ok unstaked should be reverted due to user not exist .M escrow migration does not check if lockup already ended or unstaked.
        _burn(oldUser, points);

        newLockupId = lockups[newUser].length;
        lockups[newUser].push(oldLockup);
        _mint(newUser, points);//@audit M migration also forget claim or move rewards to new user as well. If user lost their private key, they lost their rewards.
        stakingRewards.stake(newUser, points);

        delete lockups[oldUser][lockupId];
```

`VirtualStakingRewards.updateReward` is called for all user withdraw and take operation.
What it do is update latest reward for each user and update `lastUpdateTime` to current block time.

But `updateReward` still keep rewards on original address of old lockup.
Calling `getRewards()` will send that reward to original lost key address. Not the new lockUps address.

## Impact

When admin try to migrate user whom lost their private key, they will lost all staking rewards.
The rewards is not migrated along with voting TRUF tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`VirtualStakingRewards.sol` does not include migration mechanism originally.
Because admin protocol is TRUSTED. Might as well include migration mechanism only for `onlyOperator`.

```solidity
function migrateUser(address prevUser, address newUser) external onlyOperator {
    rewards[newUser] += rewards[user];
    delete rewards[user];
}
```

```js
File: VotingEscrowTruf.sol
247:         stakingRewards.stake(newUser, points);
248: 
249:         delete lockups[oldUser][lockupId];
+ 250:         stakingRewards.migrateUser(oldUser, newUser);
```
