# Anyone can lock the unclaimed rewards of a migrating user

## Summary

The function for claiming rewards does not have access control, allowing an attacker to send funds to an address no longer under the control of the original recipient.


## Vulnerability Detail

The `TrufVesting` contract, which manages the vesting of token ownership, has a function whose specific task is to allow users to migrate everything to a new address if they [lose their private key](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L303). The function migrates a user's vesting schedule and escrow locks to a new address, but does not migrate the user's earned rewards (a separate bug). Once a user is in need of the function being called, it is not correct for _more_ funds to be sent to that address. However, because the internal `VirtualStakingRewards` contract doesn't have any access control on its public [`getReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol#L126-L133) function, anyone can call that function with the old address, doing just that.

An attacker can call the function either after the migration happens (because they monitor the blockchain for migrations), or before the migration occurs (the attacker overheard the victim asking a coworker for help on what to do now that they've lost their private key).

Even if there is no migration happening, someone can call `getReward()`, causing that person to receive funds at an inopportune time (e.g. tax implications).

## Impact

Rewards that the user has already earned but has not yet claimed become locked in an address they no longer control, rather than being migratable or rescuable. Fixing the migration of unclaimed rewards in [`migrateUser()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L310) does not fix this bug.

This POC shows Alice attacking after the migration, but the attack can happen before the migration too:

## Code Snippet

Unlike the other functions, there is no `onlyOperator` modifier, and the user acted upon is not required to be `msg.sender`:
```solidity
// File: src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol : VirtualStakingRewards.getReward()   #1

126 @>     function getReward(address user) public updateReward(user) returns (uint256 reward) {
127            reward = rewards[user];
128            if (reward != 0) {
129                rewards[user] = 0;
130 @>             IERC20(rewardsToken).safeTransfer(user, reward);
131                emit RewardPaid(user, reward);
132            }
133:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Add the `onlyOperator` modifier, so the only way to get rewards is via [`VotingEscrowTruf.claimReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/VotingEscrowTruf.sol#L254-L259)
