# Migrating user forgets the claimable tokens in the virtual staking rewards contract

## Summary
When a user migrated due to losing his private key, the so far rewards that are accrued by that account are also lost because the rewards will be sent to the address that lost the private key. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In the [migrateUser](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/37ddbb69e0c7fb6510f1ec99162fd9172ec44733/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L303) function, it's apparent that the function is utilized when a vested user loses their private key.

If the migrated user has staked their vest, it can be observed [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/37ddbb69e0c7fb6510f1ec99162fd9172ec44733/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L329C63-L329C63) that the lock is also migrated in the escrow contract.

In the [migrateVestingLock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/37ddbb69e0c7fb6510f1ec99162fd9172ec44733/truflation-contracts/src/token/VotingEscrowTruf.sol#L224-L252) function, the user's vest is successfully transferred to the new address. Before that, the staked tokens are withdrawn from the virtual staking rewards contract. However, all claimable tokens from the virtual staking rewards contract are only claimable to the user's previous address, which has lost its private key. Calling [getReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/37ddbb69e0c7fb6510f1ec99162fd9172ec44733/truflation-contracts/src/staking/VirtualStakingRewards.sol#L126-L133) in the virtual staking rewards contract will only send the accrued reward tokens to the previous address that lost its private key. Consequently, the claimable tokens for the address will be lost.

## Impact
Since migration process is for protecting and saving the tokens for users and it fails to do it 100% by missing the potential claimable tokens, I'll label this as medium.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict the getReward function, make it claimable by only admin or the staker. In migration case make an exception and claim all the claimable tokens by admin and send it to the new address that the vest is migrated to.
