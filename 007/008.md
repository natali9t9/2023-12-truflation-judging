# Voting power not assigned during user migration

## Summary

Voting power not credited to new user when migrating lock ownership

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `migrateUser` is used to migrate the ownership of a vesting position to another account. This function eventually calls `migrateVestingLock` on the `VotingEscrowTruf.sol` contract, which does the actual moving of the accounts. The issue is while this function mints and burns the tokens, it does not reassign the voting power after the mint. The minting step is shown below:

The issue is that the voting power is not immediately assigned to the receiver. However this process is correctly done in the `_stake` function, where the voting power is re-assigned as well.

## Impact

Users will be left with no or low voting power after a migration. They will need to re-delegate to themselves in order to access the full amount of votes.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Assign the voting power as well like is done for the `_stake` function above.
