# user would lose voting power if migrateVestingLock() is called because it doesn't call delegate() for new address

## Summary
users should have voting power after they stake their tokens and that's why code calls `deletgate(to)` in `_stake()` function if `to` is unregistered. but this check and call doesn't happen in `migrateVestingLock()` and the migrated user would lose his voting power.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is part of `_stake()` code, as you can see if `to` is not registered code calls `delegate(to, to)` to make sure users have voting power right after they stake tokens.
```javascript
        if (delegates(to) == address(0)) {
            // Delegate voting power to the receiver, if unregistered
            _delegate(to, to);
        }
```

but there is no similar logic in `migrateVestingLock()`:
```javascript
        newLockupId = lockups[newUser].length;
        lockups[newUser].push(oldLockup);
        _mint(newUser, points);
        stakingRewards.stake(newUser, points);

        delete lockups[oldUser][lockupId];
```
so any migrated user would lose his voting power while he has staked tokens, this would break the voting power invariant("all users have voting power just after stake")

## Impact
migrated users won't have voting power while they have stake tokens. 
this would effect total vote number and other vote related stuff.
