# migrateVestingLock doesn't delegate votes to user

## Summary
`VotingEscrowTruf.migrateVestingLock` function doesn't delegate votes to user as `_stake` function does. 
## Vulnerability Detail
When `_stake` function is called, then in case if user doesn't have delegate then function [delegates his votes to himself](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/VotingEscrowTruf.sol#L169-L172), so user already has voting power after the staking and don't need to delegate.

`migrateVestingLock` function removes lock from one user and creates same lock for another user. And this function [doesn't delegate votes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/VotingEscrowTruf.sol#L246) as `_stake` function does. Thus user may not have voting power after migration as he can expect.
## Impact
Receiver of lock doesn't have voting power.
