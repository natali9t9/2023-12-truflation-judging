# Absence of Unclaimed Amount Removal Option in `cancelVesting`

## Summary
The `cancelVesting` function in the provided contract lacks a mechanism to permanently eliminate unclaimed amounts from the contract. The function currently enables the transfer of unclaimed amounts to the user but does not include an option to remove these unclaimed tokens entirely from the contract.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `cancelVesting` function is designed to cancel a user's vesting and offers the `giveUnclaimed` parameter to transfer unclaimed amounts. However, it does not provide a means to burn or permanently remove unclaimed amounts from the contract If `giveUnclaimed` is set to `false`, the unclaimed amount (`claimableAmount`) remains in the contract.
```solidity
if (giveUnclaimed && claimableAmount != 0) {
    trufToken.safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount);

    userVesting.claimed += claimableAmount;
    category.totalClaimed += claimableAmount;
    emit Claimed(categoryId, vestingId, user, claimableAmount);
}
```
## Impact
The lack of an option to permanently remove unclaimed amounts may result in a growing accumulation of unclaimed tokens in the contract. This could impact the efficiency of the contract and may have unintended consequences on the tokenomics of the project.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enhance the `cancelVesting` function to handle the scenario when `giveUnclaimed` is set to `false`. This enhancement could include implementing a mechanism to burn the unclaimed amount, either by sending it to a designated burn address or using a burn function within the contract.
