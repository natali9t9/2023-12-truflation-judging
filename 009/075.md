# Reentrancy

## Summary
The code could be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack
## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises in the callback mechanism implemented through onTokenTransfer If the external contract (receiver) contains a malicious onTokenTransfer function, it might attempt to call back into the contract initiating the transfer (transferAndCall).

## Impact

In the transferAndCall function after the super.transfer(_to, _value); call the contract then calls the _contractFallback function which could potentially make a call to an external contract via the receiver.onTokenTransfer(msg.sender, _value, _data);  line. If the external contract is malicious and implements its onTokenTransfer function to call back into this contract it could lead to reentrancy.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a reentrancy guard or ensure state changes happen before calling external contracts.
