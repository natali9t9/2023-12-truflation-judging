# `claimable` prior to cliff does not account for the emission left, leading to overdistribution

## Summary
`claimable` prior to cliff does not account for the emission left, leading to overdistribution

## Vulnerability Detail
After a user's vesting begins, up until the `cliff` timestamp, the user can claim their `initialRelease`. However, in the current implementation when the user claims their 'initialRelease` it does not take into consideration the current emission left. 
```solidity
        uint256 totalAmount = userVesting.amount;

        uint256 initialRelease = (totalAmount * info.initialReleasePct) / DENOMINATOR;

        startTime += info.cliff;

        if (startTime > block.timestamp) {
            return initialRelease;
        }
```
Since it does not account for the emission left, this allows overdistribution of funds. Furthermore, after this overdistribution happens, it would cause subsequent calls to `claimable` to revert due to underflow in the #L197 (`totalClaimed > getEmission(categoryId)`)
```solidity
        uint256 emissionLeft = getEmission(categoryId) - categories[categoryId].totalClaimed;
```

Marking this as High, as not only it causes overdistribution, but it also breaks an invariant, causing claimable to unexpectedly revert.

## Impact
Overdistribution of vesting amounts.
`claimable` unexpectedly reverting.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When returning the `initialRelease` check it against the current `emissionLeft`
