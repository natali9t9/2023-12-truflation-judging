# In function `cancelVesting`, the variable `userVesting` is type of memory, which will cause the assignment to locked to be invalid.

## Summary

In function `cancelVesting`, the variable `userVesting` is type of memory, which will cause the assignment to locked to be invalid.

## Vulnerability Detail

In function `cancelVesting` from `TrufVesting.sol`, there is an assignment to `userVesting.locked`:

```solidity
UserVesting memory userVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user];

if (lockupId != 0) {
   veTRUF.unstakeVesting(user, lockupId - 1, true);
   delete lockupIds[categoryId][vestingId][user];
   userVesting.locked = 0;
}
```

As `userVesting` is type of memory, `userVesting.locked = 0` will be invalid outside the function.

Later, `claimableAmount` will be calculated:

```solidity
uint256 claimableAmount = claimable(categoryId, vestingId, user);
```

And in function `claimable`, the calculation of `claimableAmount` is related to `userVesting.locked`. 

```solidity
uint256 maxClaimable = userVesting.amount - userVesting.locked;
```

Since the previous `userVesting.locked = 0` is invalid in function `claimable`, `maxClaimable` will be smaller than expected, and the amount that the user can claim will also be less.

## Impact

The amount that the user can claim will also be less than expected.

## Recommendation

Use storage type

```solidity
UserVesting storage userVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user];
```
