# The `cancelVesting()` function does not return the user locked funds

## Summary

The function `cancelVesting()` in `TrufVesting.sol` is an admin-callable function used to cancel an user vesting and send the currently vested amount to the user if the `giveUnclaimed` flag is set to `true`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation does not consider the locked amount to be part of the claimable amount because at [#L367](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L367) the `locked` amount is set to `0` on a `memory` variable and not a `storage` one:

```solidity
    function cancelVesting(uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, address user, bool giveUnclaimed)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        UserVesting memory userVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user]; //<-- MEMORY VARIABLE

        //...SNIP...

        if (lockupId != 0) {
            //...SNIP...
            userVesting.locked = 0; //<-- SET TO 0
        }

        uint256 claimableAmount = claimable(categoryId, vestingId, user); //<-- STORAGE VARIABLE WITH OLD LOCKED VALUE IS USED INSIDE HERE
        //...SNIP...
    }
```

And the `claimable()` function used to determine the claimable amount uses the storage variable `userVestings.locked` for calculations, which contains the previous locked value:

```solidity
    function claimable(uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, address user)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256 claimableAmount)
    {
        UserVesting memory userVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user]; //<-- STORAGE VARIABLE WITH OLD LOCKED VALUE

        //...SNIP...

        uint256 maxClaimable = userVesting.amount - userVesting.locked; //<-- OLD LOCKED VALUE IS SUBTRACTED FROM CLAIMABLE VALUE 

        //...SNIP...
    }
```


## Impact

User who got a vesting canceled and had vested funds locked receives less funds than he should.

## Recommendation

At [#L367](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-truflation/blob/main/truflation-contracts/src/token/TrufVesting.sol#L367) set the value of the `locked` variable to `0` in the storage variable:

```solidity
userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user].locked = 0;
```
